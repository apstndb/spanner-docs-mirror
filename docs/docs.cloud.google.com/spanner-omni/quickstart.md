This quickstart explains how to get started with Spanner Omni and explore some of its features by running a single-server container.

## Run a single server container

To set up and run a Spanner Omni container, follow these steps:

1.  Create a Docker volume to store Spanner Omni data. Using a volume prevents data loss if the container is accidentally deleted.
    
        docker volume create spanner

2.  Start the Spanner Omni server:
    
        docker run -d --network host --name spanneromni -v "spanner:/spanner" us-docker.pkg.dev/spanner-omni/images/spanner-omni:2026.r1-beta start-single-server
    
    The `--network host` flag opens the ports for Spanner Omni on the host machine. The following table describes the ports used by Spanner Omni:
    
    | Port range         | Purpose                     |
    | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
    | `15000` to `15025` | Spanner Omni servers        |
    | `15026`            | Spanner Omni console server |
    

3.  Ensure that the container is running:
    
        docker ps

4.  Create a sample database.
    
    Spanner Omni includes commands to create a sample database and populate it with data. The following command creates a sample database named `retail-sample` .
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner databases create-sample-db retail --database-name=retail-sample

5.  Verify that the database was created:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner databases list
    
    The output shows that a database named `retail-sample` has been created.

6.  Check the schema of the database:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner databases ddl describe retail-sample
    
    The output shows the DDL for all tables, relationships, search indexes, vector indexes, and graphs. This multi-model schema represents an ecommerce environment that tracks the customer journey from browsing to checkout. It uses advanced features like full-text search indexes, vector embeddings, and a property graph layer.

7.  Connect to the database and open the SQL shell:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner sql --database=retail-sample
    
    The `spanner-cli>` prompt appears, letting you run queries.

8.  Explore the database tables:
    
        SHOW TABLES;

## Execute queries to explore the dataset

The sample database includes data for products, users, orders, and payments. Use the following queries to explore the multi-model capabilities of Spanner Omni. The following are sample queries that demonstrate some of the functionality in Spanner Omni.

### Search for products by name

Search for products using full-text search. This query uses the `SEARCH()` function on the `Name_Tokens` column, which contains pre-processed tokens for efficient matching.

The following example searches for `phone` to find smartphones and telephones:

    SELECT ProductID, Name, Description, PriceUSD
    FROM Products
    WHERE SEARCH(Name_Tokens, 'phone')
    ORDER BY PriceUSD DESC
    LIMIT 10;

### Search for products by description

Search for products based on specific characteristics or features mentioned in their descriptions.

The following example searches for `waterproof` across all product categories:

    SELECT ProductID, Name, Description, PriceUSD
    FROM Products
    WHERE SEARCH(Description_Tokens, 'waterproof')
    ORDER BY PriceUSD
    LIMIT 10;

### Find similar products using vector search

Use vector similarity search to find products semantically similar to a reference product. This is useful for building recommendation engines. This query uses `COSINE_DISTANCE()` with `ProductEmbedding` vectors.

Replace `  PRODUCT_ID  ` with the ID of the product you want recommendations for:

    WITH
     ReferenceProduct AS (
       SELECT ProductEmbedding
       FROM Products
       WHERE ProductID = PRODUCT_ID
     )
    SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name, p.Description, p.PriceUSD
    FROM Products p, ReferenceProduct rp
    WHERE p.ProductID != PRODUCT_ID AND p.ProductEmbedding IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
     COSINE_DISTANCE(
       rp.ProductEmbedding,
       p.ProductEmbedding)
    LIMIT 5;

### Retrieve user purchase history

Retrieve the complete purchase history for a specific user, including product details and historical pricing.

Replace `  USER_ID  ` with the target user's ID:

    SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, p.Name, p.Category, oi.Quantity, oi.PriceAtOrderUSD
    FROM Orders o
    JOIN OrderItems oi
     ON o.OrderID = oi.OrderID
    JOIN Products p
     ON oi.ProductID = p.ProductID
    WHERE o.UserID = USER_ID
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC;

### Find orders by status

Use full-text search to find orders by their status. This allows for flexible matching of terms like "shipped" or "shipping".

    SELECT OrderID, UserID, OrderDate, TotalAmountUSD
    FROM Orders
    WHERE SEARCH(OrderStatus_Tokens, 'shipped')
    ORDER BY OrderDate DESC
    LIMIT 20;

### Identify high-value orders

Identify high-value orders within a specific date range for business analysis.

    SELECT OrderID, UserID, OrderDate, TotalAmountUSD
    FROM Orders
    WHERE
     OrderDate BETWEEN 'START_DATE' AND 'END_DATE'
     AND TotalAmountUSD > 500
    ORDER BY TotalAmountUSD DESC
    LIMIT 10;

### Analyze sales performance by category

Calculate sales metrics, such as units sold and total revenue, aggregated by product category.

    SELECT
     p.Category,
     COUNT(oi.OrderItemID) AS total_sales,
     SUM(oi.Quantity) AS units_sold,
     SUM(oi.PriceAtOrderUSD * oi.Quantity) AS revenue
    FROM Products p
    JOIN OrderItems oi
     ON p.ProductID = oi.ProductID
    JOIN Orders o
     ON oi.OrderID = o.OrderID
    WHERE o.OrderDate BETWEEN 'START_DATE' AND 'END_DATE'
    GROUP BY p.Category
    ORDER BY revenue DESC;

### Search for payments by method

Use full-text search to find payments performed using specific methods, such as "credit card".

    SELECT p.PaymentID, p.OrderID, p.PaymentDate, p.AmountUSD, p.Status
    FROM Payments p
    WHERE SEARCH(p.PaymentMethod_Tokens, 'credit card')
    ORDER BY p.PaymentDate DESC
    LIMIT 20;

### Find users who purchased a product using graph query

Use graph query syntax to traverse relationships and find all users who purchased a specific product.

Replace `  PRODUCT_ID  ` with the target product ID:

    GRAPH ECommerceGraph
      MATCH (p:Products { ProductID: PRODUCT_ID })<-[:OrderItems]-(o:Orders)
      MATCH (u:Users)
      WHERE u.UserID = o.UserID
      RETURN DISTINCT u.UserID, u.Email;

## Explore the Spanner Omni console
