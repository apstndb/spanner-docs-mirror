Spanner Omni includes the Spanner Omni console that shows the health and other important information about your deployments.

The Spanner Omni console supports unencrypted deployments running the [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) version of Spanner Omni. To get the features that let you create deployments with TLS encryption, [contact Google](https://cloud.google.com/consulting/spanner-omni) to request early access to the full version of Spanner Omni. For deployments that use TLS encryption, use [Prometheus alerts](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/prometheus-alerts) and [Grafana](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/grafana-dashboards) dashboards to monitor your deployments.

## Start the Spanner Omni console

Download the Spanner Omni console to run a single instance for your entire deployment. For more information, see [Download Spanner Omni](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/download) .

### Use the Spanner Omni console with single-server deployments

To start the Spanner Omni console with a single-server deployment:

1.  Follow the steps in [Set up Spanner Omni](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/setup) .

2.  Run the `start-single-server` command to start the Spanner server.

3.  Start the Spanner Omni console. If you are using containers, run the following command:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /app/bin/spanner-console

4.  In your browser, go to `http://localhost:15026` to access the Spanner Omni console.

### Use the Spanner Omni console with zonal, regional, and multi-cluster deployments

For Kubernetes-based deployments, the Spanner Omni console is deployed when you create a deployment. To access the Spanner Omni console, in your browser, go to `http:// HOST_ADDRESS :15026` .

Replace HOST\_ADDRESS with the `EXTERNAL_IP` for `spanner-omni-console` that's in the output of the following command:

    kubectl get svc -n spanner-ns

## Spanner Omni console features

The Spanner Omni console includes several pages that provide insights into your deployment.

### Overview

The **Overview** page is the central dashboard for your Spanner Omni deployment. It provides the following high-level information about the health, status, and resource utilization of your Spanner nodes:

#### Deployment information

This section lists the key identifiers for your deployment:

  - **Deployment ID** : A unique identifier for your current Spanner Omni deployment. You specify this ID when you create the deployment.

  - **Database Version** : The specific version of the Spanner Omni software that you are running (for example, `2026.r1-beta` ).

#### Deployment configuration

  - **CPU utilization** : A real-time chart that shows the processing load across your deployment. You can toggle between **Zone** and **Server** to see utilization.

  - **Resource table** : Provides a detailed view of the components in your deployment with the following information. Servers are grouped by zone.

### System insights

The **System Insights** page provides granular observability for your Spanner Omni deployment, which lets you monitor system health, analyze performance, and debug issues.

You can customize the data displayed on the dashboard with the following filters:

  - **Zones** : Filter metrics for specific deployment zones.

  - **Servers** : Drill down into individual server nodes.

  - **Databases** : View metrics for a specific database or the entire deployment.

  - **Time Range** : Select a lookback window from 1 hour up to 7 days.

#### CPU utilization

This section monitors the processing load across your deployment. You can group this metric by:

  - **Zone** : Identify load imbalances between physical locations.

  - **Priority** : See how resources are divided between high, medium, and low priority tasks.

  - **Operation Type** : Break down usage by user-initiated tasks like reads, writes, and commits.

#### Latency

This section tracks the speed of your operations:

  - **Request Latency** : The time taken for individual API requests.

  - **Transaction Latency** : The total time for complete database transactions.

  - **Percentiles** : For example, view this at the 50th percentile ( `P50` ) for median performance. However, troubleshooting often requires checking `P90` or `P99` .

#### Throughput and operations

This section shows you the following information:

  - **Throughput** : The volume of data the system reads from or writes to the deployment (measured in bytes per second).

  - **Operations per second** : The total count of API calls the system processes.

#### Lock wait time

This metric measures the cumulative time transactions spend waiting for locks. Spikes in this metric, especially when paired with high latency and normal CPU usage, often indicate lock contention.

#### Storage metrics

  - **Storage capacity** : The total and available storage space on the underlying file system, which the Spanner Omni console groups by zone.

  - **Storage utilization** : The number of bytes your databases use. The Spanner Omni data compaction process might cause temporary fluctuations in these numbers.

#### File system performance

This section provides insights into the performance of the underlying storage layer ( `SpanhostFS` ):

  - **File system latency** : The time taken for low-level I/O operations (read, write, and flush).

  - **File system throughput** : The rate of data transfer at the file system level.

### Query insights

The **Query Insights** page helps you detect and diagnose performance issues for your SQL queries and DML ( `INSERT` , `UPDATE` , and `DELETE` ) statements. Use Query Insights to identify inefficient queries that might contribute to high CPU utilization.

  - **Detection** : Determine if your queries are the primary cause of your deployment's CPU load.

  - **Identification** : Pinpoint the specific queries or application request tags that are the most resource-intensive.

  - **Analysis** : Use granular metrics like latency and row counts to understand why a query might be slow.

#### Database load by execution time (all queries)

**Database load by execution time** displays the aggregate CPU usage for all queries over time. To show the load for a specific database, use a database filter.

#### Top N queries and tags

This section provides a time-series view of the queries or tags that are causing the most database load within the selected timeframe.

#### Top queries and tags table

The table lists the top-consuming queries and tags. You can use this to identify the most resource-intensive queries in your query workload.

| Column               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
