> **Preview**
> 
> This product or feature is a preview offering subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the [General Service Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms) section of the Service Specific Terms, and can only be used for the purposes of developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating software programs. It cannot be used for any data processing or commercial purposes. Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

Use this document to learn about the key differences between the cloud-based, managed Spanner service and the self-managed, downloadable Spanner Omni database.

While both products share the same distributed database engine, they differ in how you deploy, scale, secure, and manage them.

## Core differences and management model

The following table compares the licensing, environments, and service-level agreements (SLAs) for the two products.

| Feature                       | Spanner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Spanner Omni                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Management model and environment differences 

## Feature support and compatibility

Google strives for feature parity between Spanner and Spanner Omni. However, there are differences between the managed version of Spanner that runs in Google Cloud and Spanner Omni. While Spanner Omni runs the same underlying query engine, it doesn't support all of the features in the cloud-managed service. The following table lists the primary differences.

## Security, authentication, and authorization

The security implementation of the self-managed model uses a shared responsibility structure. The following table outlines the security configurations and access controls.

| Security model        | Google manages physical and infrastructure security.                                                                                                                                                                                                | You secure the compute servers, storage, network perimeter, and container environments. For more information, see [authentication and authorization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/authentication) .                                                                                                                                     |
| Encryption at rest    | Data at rest is encrypted by default. You can configure customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) using Cloud Key Management Service. For more information, see [customer-managed encryption keys](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/cmek) . | Built-in encryption at rest isn't provided. You must configure disk-level or file-system-level encryption (for example, block device encryption). For more information, see the [security overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/authentication) .                                                                                      |
| Encryption in transit | Google automatically manages and enforces TLS encryption.                                                                                                                                                                                           | You must configure TLS 1.3 for client-server connections and mutual TLS (mTLS) for server-server connections. For more information, see [VM deployment encryption](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/deploy-encryption-vms) or [Kubernetes deployment encryption](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/deploy-encryption-kubernetes) . |
| Authentication        | You authenticate using Identity and Access Management (IAM) configurations (service accounts, users, and groups). For more information, see [IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/iam) .                                                 | You authenticate using passwords (OPAQUE protocol) or client certificates. For more information, see [authentication](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/authentication) .                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Authorization         | You authorize actions using IAM roles and permissions. For more information, see [access control with IAM](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/iam) .                                                                                        | You authorize actions using an internal, IAM-like role system (for example, `roles/spanner.databaseUser` ) that is separate from IAM. This system doesn't support custom roles. For more information, see [authorization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/authentication) .                                                                |
