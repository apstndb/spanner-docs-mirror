This page describes how to start Spanner Omni in single-server mode. You can either install it using a TAR file or run it as a container using Docker.

## Before you begin

Before you set up your Spanner Omni instance, ensure you meet the following requirements:

  - Verify your machine meets the [system requirements](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner-omni/system-requirements) .

  - Ensure you have `sudo` access in your environment to set up the Spanner Omni binary.

  - Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on your machine for container-based installations.

## Run using Docker

We recommend storing Spanner data in a [Docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) to ensure data persistence if you delete the container.

1.  Create a Docker volume:
    
        docker volume create spanner

2.  Start the Spanner Omni server container. Replace VERSION\_TAG with the Spanner Omni version you want to use. The current version is `2026.r1-beta.1` .
    
        docker run -d --network host \
            --name spanneromni \
            -v "spanner:/spanner" \
            us-docker.pkg.dev/spanner-omni/images/spanner-omni:VERSION_TAG \
            start-single-server
    
    The `--network host` flag maps the Spanner Omni ports to the host machine.

3.  Verify that the container is running:
    
        docker ps
    
    Check the **STATUS** field in the output to ensure the container is healthy.

### Interact with the containerized server

You can use `docker exec` to run Spanner Omni CLI commands inside the container:

1.  Create a database:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner databases create DATABASE_NAME

2.  Open the SQL shell:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner sql --database=DATABASE_NAME

3.  List databases:
    
        docker exec -it spanneromni /google/spanner/bin/spanner databases list
