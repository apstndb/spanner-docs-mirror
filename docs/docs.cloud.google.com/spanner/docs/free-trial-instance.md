**Note:** A Spanner free trial instance supports Standard edition features, and Enterprise edition features, such as [KNN](/spanner/docs/find-k-nearest-neighbors) , [ANN vector distance functions](/spanner/docs/find-approximate-nearest-neighbors) , [full-text search](/spanner/docs/full-text-search) , and [Spanner Graph](/spanner/docs/graph/overview) . For more information, see the [Spanner editions overview](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) .

This page provides an overview of Spanner free trial instances.

A Spanner free trial instance lets you learn and explore Spanner features and capabilities at no cost for up to 90 days. Using a Spanner free trial instance, you can create GoogleSQL or PostgreSQL-dialect databases and store up to 10 GB of data to test out key Spanner features, and learn key Spanner concepts.

You can [create a Spanner free trial instance](/spanner/docs/free-trial-quickstart#create) using the Google Cloud console or Google Cloud CLI.

## Explore sample databases and applications

When you create the free trial instance using the Google Cloud console, Spanner creates and preloads a sample database for an ecommerce store in the free trial instance. The sample database schema defines entities for users, products, orders, shopping carts, order items, addresses, and payments. Spanner inserts sample data into the ecommerce database. You can view saved queries on the Spanner Studio page for the sample database that help showcase the following Spanner capabilities:

  - The relational model
  - Full-text search
  - Vector search for product similarity
  - Graph relationships between entities such as users, orders, and products

You can also create new databases, define schema, and load data in the free trial instance. To learn more, see [Create a Spanner free trial instance and sample application](/spanner/docs/free-trial-quickstart) .

In addition to the ecommerce use case database, Spanner offers an open source [sample application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-spanner-samples) to help you get started with the Spanner free trial instance. The sample application includes a backend gRPC service backed by a Spanner database and a workload generator that drives traffic to the service.

## Cost and eligibility

A Spanner free trial instance is available at no cost to both existing and new Google Cloud customers. If you're a new Google Cloud customer, you might also be eligible for the [Google Cloud 90-day, $300 Free Trial](/free/docs/free-cloud-features#free-trial) that offers $300 in free Cloud Billing credits to pay for any Google Cloud resources. The Spanner free trial instance is in addition to the $300 Free Trial credits offered by the Google Cloud Free Trial, and you don't need to use any free Cloud Billing credits to create a free trial instance.

  - Free trial instances don't support [customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)](/spanner/docs/cmek) .
  - Spanner free trial instances are available in all [regional configurations](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#available-configurations-regional) . They aren't available in [dual-region](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#dual-region-configurations) or [multi-region configurations](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#multi-region-configurations) .

The free trial instance is meant for evaluation purposes. It is not meant for the following use cases:

  - Production related activities
  - Performance evaluation and load testing of Spanner
  - Ongoing testing and development

## Performance

**Note:** These performance numbers are estimates only. Spanner performance is highly dependent on workload, schema design, and dataset characteristics.

A Spanner free trial instance can provide around 500 queries per second (QPS) of reads or 100 QPS of writes (writing single rows at 1 KB of data per row) when you follow these best practices:

  - [Design a schema](/spanner/docs/schema-design) that prevents hotspots and other performance issues.
  - [Write efficient queries](/spanner/docs/sql-best-practices) and follow other SQL best practices.
  - Keep high priority [total CPU utilization under 65%](/spanner/docs/cpu-utilization#recommended-max) as recommended.
  - Place compute resources within the same region as your Spanner instance, for optimal read and write latency.

You can monitor and optimize the performance of your free trial instance with the help of:

  - [Monitoring charts and metrics](/spanner/docs/monitoring-console#charts-metrics)
  - [Query Insights](/spanner/docs/using-query-insights)
  - [Query plan visualizer](/spanner/docs/tune-query-with-visualizer)
  - [Introspection tools](/spanner/docs/introspection)
  - [Spanner Key Visualizer](/spanner/docs/key-visualizer)

For better performance, upgrade your free trial instance to a paid instance and scale up the [compute capacity](/spanner/docs/compute-capacity) of your instance.

## Upgrade from free trial instances

You can upgrade your Spanner free trial instance to a paid Enterprise edition instance anytime during the 90-day free trial instance period without any downtime. You aren't charged unless you explicitly upgrade your free trial instance to a paid instance.

Upgrading your Spanner free trial instance has the following benefits:

  - Keeps your Spanner free trial instance running uninterrupted beyond the 90-day free trial period.
  - Gives you access to Spanner features that aren't available in the free trial instance, such as backups and managed autoscaler. You can also upgrade to the Enterprise Plus edition for additional features, such as geo-partitioning and multi-regional configurations with 99.999% availability.
  - Lets you increase the compute capacity of your instance and obtain higher performance (QPS, throughput) and storage capacity (greater than 10 GB).

As an option, you can opt in to automatically upgrade your free trial instance to a paid Enterprise edition instance after 90 days. For more information, see [Upgrade free trial instance](/spanner/docs/free-trial-quickstart#upgrade) .

If don't want to use the Enterprise edition, upgrade your free trial instance to the paid Enterprise edition first. Then, you can upgrade your instance to the Enterprise Plus edition, or contact support to downgrade to the Standard edition. For more information, see the [Spanner editions overview](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) .
