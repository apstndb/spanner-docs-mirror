This page describes how to manage foreign key relationships in your database.

A foreign key is a column that is shared between tables to establish a link between related data. When you use a foreign key, Spanner ensures that this relationship is maintained.

The following diagram shows a basic database schema where data in a table has a relationship to data in another table.

**Figure 1.** Diagram of an order processing database schema

There are three tables in the schema shown in Figure 1:

  - The `  Customers  ` table records the names of each customer.
  - The `  Orders  ` tables keeps track of all orders made.
  - The `  Products  ` table stores the product information for every product.

There are two foreign key relationships between these tables:

  - A foreign key relationship is defined between the `  Orders  ` table and the `  Customers  ` table to ensure that an order can't be created unless there is a corresponding customer.

  - A foreign key relationship between the `  Orders  ` table and the `  Products  ` table ensures that an order can't be created for a product that doesn't exist.

Using the previous schema as an example, this topic discusses the Data Definition Language ( *DDL* ) `  CONSTRAINT  ` statements that you can use to manage relationships between tables in a database.

By default, all foreign keys in Spanner are enforced foreign keys, which enforce referential integrity. In Spanner you can also choose to use [informational foreign keys](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#informational-foreign-keys) , which don't validate or enforce referential integrity. For more information, see [Comparison of foreign keys](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#comparison-of-foreign-keys-types) and [Choose which foreign key type to use](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#choose-foreign-key-type) . When unspecified, the foreign keys in examples on this page are enforced foreign keys.

## Add a foreign key to a new table

Assume that you've created a `  Customers  ` table in your basic product ordering database. You now need an `  Orders  ` table to store information about the orders that customers make. To ensure all orders are valid, you don't want to let the system insert rows into the `  Orders  ` table unless there's also a matching entry in the `  Customers  ` table. Therefore, you need an enforced foreign key to establish a relationship between the two tables. One choice is to add a `  CustomerID  ` column to the new table and use it as the foreign key to create a relationship with the `  CustomerID  ` column in the `  Customers  ` table.

When you create a new table with a foreign key, you use `  REFERENCE  ` to establish a relationship to another table. The table that contains the `  REFERENCE  ` statement is called the *referencing* table. The table named in the `  REFERENCE  ` statement is the *referenced* table. The column that is named in the `  REFERENCE  ` statement is called the *referencing* column.

The following example shows how to use the `  CREATE TABLE  ` DDL statement to create the `  Orders  ` table with a foreign key constraint that references `  CustomerID  ` in the `  Customers  ` table.

### GoogleSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID INT64 NOT NULL,
CustomerID INT64 NOT NULL,
Quantity INT64 NOT NULL,
ProductID INT64 NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrder FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID)
) PRIMARY KEY (OrderID);
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID BIGINT NOT NULL,
CustomerID BIGINT NOT NULL,
Quantity BIGINT NOT NULL,
ProductID BIGINT NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrder FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID),
PRIMARY KEY (OrderID)
);
```

The previous statement contains a `  CONSTRAINT  ` clause that has the following characteristics:

  - Use of the `  CONSTRAINT  ` syntax to name a constraint, making it easier to drop the table using the name you've chosen.

  - The constraint has the name `  FK_CustomerOrder  ` . Constraint names are scoped to the schema and must be unique within the schema.

  - The `  Orders  ` table, on which you define the constraint, is the referencing table. The `  Customers  ` table is the referenced table.

  - The referencing column in the referencing table is `  CustomerID  ` . It references the `  CustomerID  ` field in the `  Customers  ` table. If someone tries to insert a row into `  Orders  ` with a `  CustomerID  ` that doesn't exist in `  Customers  ` , the insert fails.

**Note:** Often the referenced columns of the referenced table correspond to the primary key columns, but this is not required. A referencing table may also reference non-primary columns of a referenced table.

The following example shows an alternative table creation statement. Here, the foreign key constraint is defined without a name. When you use this syntax, Spanner generates a name for you. To discover the names of all foreign keys, refer to [View properties of a foreign key relationship](#view_props) .

### GoogleSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID INT64 NOT NULL,
CustomerID INT64 NOT NULL,
ProductID INT64 NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID)
) PRIMARY KEY (OrderID);
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID BIGINT NOT NULL,
CustomerID BIGINT NOT NULL,
Quantity BIGINT NOT NULL,
ProductID BIGINT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID),
PRIMARY KEY (OrderID)
);
```

## Add a foreign key to an existing table

You also want to make sure that customers can only order products that exist. If your table has existing constraints, you must [drop all of the constraints](#drop-foreign-key) . In Spanner, all enforced constraints in a table must be implemented at the same time in a single batch DDL statement.

If your table has no existing constraints, you can use the `  ALTER TABLE  ` DDL statement to add an [enforced foreign key constraint](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#constraint_validation) to the existing `  Orders  ` table as shown in the following example:

``` text
ALTER TABLE Orders
  ADD CONSTRAINT DB_ProductOrder FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products (ProductID);
```

The referencing column in `  Orders  ` is `  ProductID  ` , and it references the `  ProductID  ` column in `  Products  ` . If you are fine with Spanner naming these constraints for you, use the following syntax:

``` text
ALTER TABLE Orders
  ADD FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products (ProductID);
```

## Add a foreign key with a delete action to a new table

Recall the previous example where you have a `  Customers  ` table in a product ordering database that needs an `  Orders  ` table. You want to add a foreign key constraint that references the `  Customers  ` table. However, you want to ensure that when you delete a customer record in the future, Spanner also deletes all orders for that customer. In this case, you want to use the `  ON DELETE CASCADE  ` action with the foreign key constraint.

The following `  CREATE TABLE  ` DDL statement for the `  Orders  ` table includes the foreign key constraint that references the `  Customers  ` table with an `  ON DELETE CASCADE  ` action.

### GoogleSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID INT64 NOT NULL,
CustomerID INT64 NOT NULL,
Quantity INT64 NOT NULL,
ProductID INT64 NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrder FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID)
  REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE
) PRIMARY KEY (OrderID);
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
OrderID BIGINT NOT NULL,
CustomerID BIGINT NOT NULL,
Quantity BIGINT NOT NULL,
ProductID BIGINT NOT NULL,
FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID)
  REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE,
PRIMARY KEY (OrderID)
);
```

The previous statement contains a foreign key constraint with an `  ON DELETE CASCADE  ` clause. The `  CustomerID  ` column is a foreign key that references the `  CustomerID  ` field in the `  Customers  ` table. This means that each `  CustomerID  ` value in the `  Orders  ` table must also exist in the `  Customers  ` table. If someone tries to delete a row from the `  Customers  ` table, all of the rows in the `  Orders  ` table that reference the deleted `  CustomerID  ` value are also deleted in the same transaction.

**Note:** If you don't specify a foreign key action, the default action is `  NO ACTION  ` . This means that if someone tries to delete a row from the `  Customers  ` table, and there are rows in the `  Orders  ` table that reference the deleted `  CustomerID  ` value, the delete operation fails with a foreign key constraint violation error.

## Add a foreign key with a delete action to a table

You also want to make sure that orders are only created for products that exist. You can use `  ALTER TABLE  ` to add another foreign key constraint with `  ON DELETE CASCADE  ` action to the orders table as follows:

``` text
ALTER TABLE Orders
  ADD CONSTRAINT DB_ProductOrder FOREIGN KEY (ProductID)
    REFERENCES Products (ProductID) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

Deleting a row from the `  Products  ` table deletes all of the rows in the `  Orders  ` table that reference the deleted `  ProductID  ` value.

**Note:** Adding or dropping a foreign key action on an existing foreign key constraint isn't supported. You need to add a new foreign key constraint with an action. For more information, see [Long-running schema changes](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/how-to#long-running-schema-changes) .

## Use informational foreign keys (GoogleSQL only)

[Informational foreign keys](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#informational-foreign-keys) let the [query optimizer](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#informational-fk-query-optimization) make use of the foreign key relationship without the overhead incurred from referential integrity checks performed by [enforced foreign keys](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#enforced-foreign-keys) . Informational foreign keys are useful when enforcing strict referential integrity is either impractical or incurs significant performance overhead.

Continuing with the previous example, imagine you want to model the relationships between the `  Customers  ` , `  Orders  ` , and `  Products  ` tables. However, enforcing strict referential integrity in the data of the tables might introduce performance bottlenecks, especially during peak shopping periods with high order volumes. Additionally, customers might place orders for products that were discontinued and removed from the `  Products  ` table.

You can create the `  Orders  ` table using informational foreign keys:

``` text
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT64 NOT NULL,
    CustomerID INT64 NOT NULL,
    Quantity INT64 NOT NULL,
    ProductID INT64 NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrder FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID) NOT ENFORCED,
    CONSTRAINT FK_ProductOrder FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products (ProductID) NOT ENFORCED
) PRIMARY KEY (OrderID);
```

By creating an informational foreign key with `  NOT ENFORCED  ` , you allow for the possibility that an order might reference a non-existent customer or product. Using an informational foreign key instead of an enforced foreign key constraint is a good choice if a customer account might be deleted or a product might be discontinued. With an informational foreign key, Spanner doesn't perform referential integrity validation. This reduces the write overhead, potentially improving performance during peak order processing times.

You can allow the query optimizer to use the relationships to generate efficient query plans. This can improve the performance of queries that join the tables on foreign key columns. For more information, see [informational foreign key for query optimization](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#informational-fk-query-optimization) .

**Caution:** If your application logic requires strict referential integrity (for example, preventing orders for products that don't exist), you need to implement additional checks at the application level. Query results might be affected if there are inconsistencies in the data. For example, a query joining `  Orders  ` with `  Products  ` might return an order with a discontinued `  ProductID  ` if the optimizer uses an informational foreign key.

## Query data across foreign key relationships

``` text
SELECT * FROM Orders
  INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
  INNER JOIN Products ON Orders.ProductsID = Products.ProductID;
```

## Referential integrity with enforced foreign keys

The main reason for adding enforced foreign key relationships is so that Spanner can maintain the [referential integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity) of your data. If you modify data in a way that breaks a foreign key constraint, the update fails with an error.

Consider the data in Figure 2. Some customers have ordered products, as shown in the `  Orders  ` table. Because of the [enforced foreign key constraint](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#enforced-foreign-keys) that are in place, the data that was inserted into the `  Orders  ` table has referential integrity.

**Figure 2.** Sample data for in our ordering database.

The following examples show what happens when you try to modify the data in a way that would break referential integrity.

  - Add a row into the `  Orders  ` table with a `  CustomerID  ` value that does not exist in `  Customers  `
    
    What happens if you try the following modification, given the sample data from the preceding diagram?
    
    ``` text
    INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, CustomerID)
    VALUES (19, 337876, 4, 447);
    ```
    
    In this case, the system would try to insert a row into `  Orders  ` with a `  CustomerID  ` (447) that doesn't exist in the `  Customers  ` table. If the system did this, you would have an invalid order in your system. However, with the enforced foreign key constraint you added to your `  Orders  ` table, your table is protected. The `  INSERT  ` fails with the following message, assuming the constraint is called `  FK_CustomerOrder  ` .
    
    ``` text
    Foreign key constraint `FK_CustomerOrder` is violated on table `Orders`.
    Cannot find referenced values in Customers(CustomerID).
    ```
    
    Unlike enforced foreign keys, informational foreign keys don't enforce referential integrity. If `  FK_CustomerOrder  ` is an informational foreign key, then the insert statement succeeds because Spanner doesn't validate that the corresponding `  CustomerID  ` exists in the `  Customers  ` table. Because of this, the data might not conform to the referential integrity defined by `  FK_CustomerOrder  ` .

  - Attempt to delete a row from the `  Customers  ` table when the customer is referenced in an [enforced foreign key constraint](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#constraint_validation) .
    
    Imagine a situation where a customer unsubscribes from your online store. You want to remove the customer from your backend, so you attempt the following operation.
    
    ``` text
    DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 721;
    ```
    
    In this example, Spanner detects through the foreign key constraint that there are still records in the `  Orders  ` table that reference the customer row you are trying to delete. The following error is displayed in this case.
    
    ``  Foreign key constraint violation when deleting or updating referenced row(s): referencing row(s) found in table `Orders`.  ``
    
    To fix this issue, you delete all referencing entries in `  Orders  ` first. You can also define the foreign key with the `  ON DELETE CASCADE  ` action to let Spanner handle deletion of referencing entries.
    
    Similarly, if `  FK_CustomerOrder  ` is an informational foreign key, then the delete action succeeds because Spanner doesn't guarantee the referential integrity of informational foreign keys.

## View properties of a foreign key relationship

Spanner's [INFORMATION\_SCHEMA](/spanner/docs/information-schema) contains information about foreign keys and their backing indexes. The following are some examples of the questions you can answer by querying the INFORMATION SCHEMA.

For more information on backing indexes, see [Foreign keys backing indexes](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#backing-indexes) .

*What constraints are defined in my database?*

``` text
SELECT tc.CONSTRAINT_NAME, tc.TABLE_NAME, tc.CONSTRAINT_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS as tc
WHERE tc.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'FOREIGN KEY';
```

*What foreign keys are defined in my database?*

``` text
SELECT rc.CONSTRAINT_NAME, rc.UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT_NAME, rc.SPANNER_STATE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS as rc;
```

*Which indexes are secondary indexes for foreign keys, also known as backing indexes?*

Foreign key backing indexes are managed by Spanner , so querying for `  SPANNER_IS_MANAGED  ` on the `  INDEXES  ` view returns all backing indexes.

``` text
SELECT i.TABLE_NAME, i.INDEX_NAME, i.INDEX_TYPE, i.INDEX_STATE,
  i.IS_UNIQUE, i.IS_NULL_FILTERED, i.SPANNER_IS_MANAGED
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INDEXES as i
WHERE SPANNER_IS_MANAGED = 'YES';
```

*What is the referential action defined with the foreign key constraint?*

``` text
SELECT rc.CONSTRAINT_NAME, rc.UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT_NAME, rc.DELETE_RULE,
  rc.UPDATE_RULE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS as rc;
```

*Is a foreign key [enforced](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#enforced-foreign-keys) or [not enforced](/spanner/docs/foreign-keys/overview#informational-foreign-keys) ?*

``` text
SELECT tc.CONSTRAINT_NAME, tc.TABLE_NAME, tc.CONSTRAINT_TYPE, tc.ENFORCED
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS as tc
WHERE tc.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'FOREIGN KEY';
```

For more information, see [Information Schema](/spanner/docs/information-schema) .

## Remove a foreign key relationship

The following DDL drops a foreign key constraint from the `  Orders  ` table.

``` text
ALTER TABLE Orders
  DROP CONSTRAINT FK_CustomerOrder;
```

The foreign key backing indexes are dropped automatically when the constraint itself is dropped.

## Support for more complex foreign key relationships

The following topics show you how to use foreign keys to enforce more complex relationships between tables.

### Multiple columns

Foreign keys can reference multiple columns. The list of columns form a key that corresponds to a table's primary key or to a backing index. The referencing table contains foreign keys of the referenced table key.

In the following example, the enforced foreign key definitions indicate that:

  - Each `  SongName  ` value in the `  TopHits  ` table must have a matching value in the `  Songs  ` table.

  - Each `  SingerFirstName  ` and `  SingerLastName  ` pair of values must have a matching `  FirstName  ` and `  LastName  ` pair of values in the `  Singers  ` table.

### GoogleSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE TopHits (
Rank INT64 NOT NULL,
SongName STRING(MAX),
SingerFirstName STRING(MAX),
SingerLastName STRING(MAX),

-- Song names must either be NULL or have matching values in Songs.
FOREIGN KEY (SongName) REFERENCES Songs (SongName),

-- Singer names must either be NULL or have matching values in Singers.
FOREIGN KEY (SingerFirstName, SingerLastName)
REFERENCES Singers (FirstName, LastName)

) PRIMARY KEY (Rank);
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE TopHits (
Rank BIGINT NOT NULL,
SongName VARCHAR,
SingerFirstName VARCHAR,
SingerLastName VARCHAR,

-- Song names must either be NULL or have matching values in Songs.
FOREIGN KEY (SongName) REFERENCES Songs (SongName),

-- Singer names must either be NULL or have matching values in Singers.
FOREIGN KEY (SingerFirstName, SingerLastName)
REFERENCES Singers (FirstName, LastName),

PRIMARY KEY (Rank)
);
```

### Circular references

Occasionally tables have circular dependencies, perhaps for legacy reasons or due to denormalization. Spanner foreign keys permit circular references. Since a referenced table must exist before a foreign key can reference it, one of the foreign keys must be added with an `  ALTER TABLE  ` statement. Here's an example

1.  Create `  TableA  ` , without a foreign key.
2.  Create `  TableB  ` with a foreign key constraint on `  TableA  ` .
3.  Use `  ALTER TABLE  ` on `  TableA  ` to create a foreign key reference to `  TableB  ` .

### Self-referencing tables

One special type of circular reference is a table that defines a foreign key that references the same table. For example, the following snippet shows a foreign key to enforce that an employee's ManagerId is also an employee.

### GoogleSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Employees (
EmployeeId INT64 NOT NULL,
EmployeeName STRING(MAX) NOT NULL,
ManagerId INT64,
FOREIGN KEY (ManagerId) REFERENCES Employees (EmployeeId)
) PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeId);
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
CREATE TABLE Employees (
EmployeeId BIGINT NOT NULL,
EmployeeName VARCHAR NOT NULL,
ManagerId BIGINT,
FOREIGN KEY (ManagerId) REFERENCES Employees (EmployeeId),
PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeId)
);
```
