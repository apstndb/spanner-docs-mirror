This page defines the characteristics, constraints, and intended use of the three predefined system roles that fine-grained access control provides for each database. Each system role has a different set of privileges, which can't be revoked. This information applies to both GoogleSQL-dialect databases and PostgreSQL-dialect databases.

### `     public    ` system role

  - All fine-grained access control users have IAM membership in `  public  ` by default.

  - All database roles inherit privileges from this role.

  - Initially, `  public  ` has no privileges, but you can grant it privileges. If you grant a privilege to `  public  ` , it's available to all database roles, including database roles created afterward.

### `     spanner_info_reader    ` system role

  - This role has the `  SELECT  ` privilege on [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  `](/spanner/docs/information-schema) views for GoogleSQL-dialect databases and [`  information_schema  `](/spanner/docs/information-schema-pg) views for PostgreSQL-dialect databases.

  - You can't grant any other privileges to `  spanner_info_reader  ` .

  - Grant membership in this role to any database role that needs to have unfiltered read access to the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views (GoogleSQL-dialect databases) or the `  information_schema  ` views (PostgreSQL-dialect databases).

### `     spanner_sys_reader    ` system role

  - This role has the `  SELECT  ` privilege on `  SPANNER_SYS  ` tables.

  - You can't grant any other privileges to `  spanner_sys_reader  ` .

  - Grant membership in this role to any database role that must have read access to the `  SPANNER_SYS  ` schema.

## Restrictions on system roles

  - You can't delete a system role by using a `  DROP ROLE  ` statement.

  - System roles can't be members of other database roles. That is, the following GoogleSQL statement is invalid:
    
    ``` text
    GRANT ROLE pii_access TO ROLE spanner_info_reader;
    ```

  - You can't grant membership in the `  public  ` role to your database roles. For example, the following GoogleSQL statement is also invalid:
    
    ``` text
    GRANT ROLE public TO ROLE pii_access;
    ```
    
    However, you can grant membership in the `  spanner_info_reader  ` and `  spanner_sys_reader  ` roles. For example, the following are valid statements.
    
    ### GoogleSQL
    
    ```` text
      GRANT ROLE spanner_info_reader TO ROLE pii_access;
      GRANT ROLE spanner_sys_reader TO ROLE pii_access;
      ```
    ````
    
    ### PostgreSQL
    
    ``` text
    GRANT spanner_info_reader TO pii_access;
    GRANT spanner_sys_reader TO pii_access;
    ```
