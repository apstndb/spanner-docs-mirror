## What is Key Visualizer?

Key Visualizer helps you analyze your Spanner data access patterns.

Understanding data access patterns is critical for following [schema design best practices](/spanner/docs/schema-design) and avoiding hotspots. Hotspots occur when too many requests are sent to the same server which saturates the resources of the server and potentially causes high latencies.

With Key Visualizer, you can diagnose common issues that cause hotspots. It generates visual reports to show how data is accessed in your database. In addition, you can identify usage patterns over time that are difficult to understand otherwise.
