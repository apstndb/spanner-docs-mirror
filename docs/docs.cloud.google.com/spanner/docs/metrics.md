The following Spanner metrics are provided to Cloud Monitoring. For the best performance debugging results, use server-side metrics with [client-side metrics](/spanner/docs/view-manage-client-side-metrics) .

The "metric type" strings in this table must be prefixed with `  spanner.googleapis.com/  ` . That prefix has been omitted from the entries in the table. When querying a label, use the `  metric.labels.  ` prefix; for example, `  metric.labels. LABEL =" VALUE "  ` .

Transaction participants
