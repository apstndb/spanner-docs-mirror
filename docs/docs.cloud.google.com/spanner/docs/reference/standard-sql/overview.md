This page provides an overview of supported statements in GoogleSQL.

GoogleSQL is an ANSI-compliant [Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) that includes the following types of supported statements:

  - [**Data Definition Language** (DDL) statements](/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language) let you create and modify database objects such as tables, views, and database roles.
  - [**Data Manipulation Language** (DML) statements](/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax) enable you to update, insert, and delete data from your Spanner tables.
  - [**Query statements**](/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) , also known as Data Query Language (DQL) statements, are the primary method to analyze data in Spanner. They scan one or more tables or expressions and return the computed result rows.
  - [**Data Access Control statements**](/spanner/docs/fgac-about) let you grant and revoke access privileges at the table and column level.
