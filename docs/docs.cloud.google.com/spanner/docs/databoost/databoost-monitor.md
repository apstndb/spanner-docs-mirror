This page describes how to use Cloud Monitoring and Spanner audit logs to monitor and analyze Spanner Data Boost usage.

Cloud Monitoring provides the ability to track total usage over time and to break down that usage by user. Spanner audit logs allow more flexible usage analysis, including providing metrics by user or by BigQuery job ID.

## Use Cloud Monitoring to track Data Boost usage

Follow these steps to track overall Data Boost usage:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to **Monitoring** .  

2.  If **Metrics Explorer** is shown in the navigation menu, select it. Otherwise, click **Resources** , and then select **Metrics Explorer** .

3.  At the top of the page, select a time interval.

4.  In the **Metric** drop-down list, in the **Filter by resource or metric name** field, enter `  spanner  ` and press `  Enter  ` to narrow the search.

5.  In the **Metric** list, select **Cloud Spanner Instance \> Instance \> Processing unit second** , and then click **Apply** .
    
    This creates a line chart of aggregate Data Boost usage across all Spanner instances.

6.  To view usage for a particular instance, follow these steps:
    
    1.  Use the **Filter** field to add filters, such as the instance ID.
    2.  Click **+** to add other attributes.

7.  To view a breakdown of usage by all instances, follow these steps:
    
    1.  Clear any filters by clicking the **X** icon next to the filter fields.
    2.  In the **Aggregation** operator drop-down list, select **Sum** , and then select by **instance\_id** .

8.  To break down usage by principal, in the **Aggregation** operator drop-down, select **Sum** , and then select by **credential\_id** .

## Use audit logs to analyze Data Boost usage

Spanner audit logs allow more flexible analysis of Data Boost usage. In addition to the ability to break down usage over time by instance or principal as with Cloud Monitoring, Spanner audit logs, if enabled and available, allow breaking down usage over time by database or BigQuery job ID.

Enabling audit logs can incur extra charges. For information about Logging pricing, see [Google Cloud Observability pricing: Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/pricing#logging-costs) .

### Enable Data Boost usage audit logs

You must enable data access audit logs for Spanner before you can collect usage data for Data Boost. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Follow the instructions in [Configure Data Access audit logs with the Google Cloud console](/logging/docs/audit/configure-data-access#config-console) .
2.  Enable the **Data Read** log type for the **Spanner API** service.
3.  To obtain Data Boost usage by BigQuery job SQL text, ensure that that the audit logs for BigQuery are enabled as well.

### View usage by principal

To query the audit logs to view Data Boost usage by user, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud console.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Log Analytics** .

3.  To show usage by user and database over the past 7 days, run the following query. To change the timespan for which usage is shown, modify the `  timestamp  ` expression in the `  WHERE  ` clause.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      SUM(CAST(JSON_VALUE(labels.data_boost_usage) AS INT64)) AS usage,
      REGEXP_EXTRACT(
        proto_payload.audit_log.resource_name,
        'projects/[^/]+/instances/[^/]+/databases/[^/]+') AS database,
      proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email AS principal_email
    FROM `PROJECT_NAME.global._Default._AllLogs`
    WHERE
      timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
      AND resource.type = 'spanner_instance' AND operation.last IS NULL
      AND JSON_VALUE(labels.data_boost_usage) != ''
    GROUP BY database, principal_email;
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_NAME  ` with your project name.

The following example shows usage in processing units for 4 principals.

### View usage by BigQuery job ID

To query the audit logs to view Data Boost usage broken down by database, user, and BigQuery job ID, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud console.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Log Analytics** .

3.  Run the following query:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      SUM(CAST(JSON_VALUE(labels.data_boost_usage) AS INT64)) AS usage,
      REGEXP_EXTRACT(
        proto_payload.audit_log.resource_name,
        'projects/[^/]+/instances/[^/]+/databases/[^/]+') AS database,
      proto_payload.audit_log.authentication_info.principal_email AS principal_email,
      IFNULL(JSON_VALUE(labels.data_boost_workload_id), 'not from BigQuery') AS job_id
    FROM `PROJECT_NAME.global._Default._AllLogs`
    WHERE
      timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
      AND resource.type = 'spanner_instance' AND operation.last IS NULL
      AND JSON_VALUE(labels.data_boost_usage) != ''
    GROUP BY database, principal_email, job_id;
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_NAME  ` with your project name.

The following example shows usage by BigQuery job ID.

### View usage by BigQuery SQL text

To view Data Boost usage for multiple BigQuery jobs aggregated by the SQL text of those jobs, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud console.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Log Analytics** .

3.  Run the following query:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      SUM(
        CAST(
          JSON_VALUE(db.labels.data_boost_usage)
          AS INT64)) AS usage,
      JSON_VALUE(
        bq.proto_payload.audit_log.metadata.jobInsertion.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.query)
        AS bq_query
    FROM
      `PROJECT_NAME.global._Default._AllLogs` db,
      `PROJECT_NAME.global._Default._AllLogs` bq
    WHERE
      db.timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
      AND db.resource.type = 'spanner_instance'
      AND JSON_VALUE(db.labels.data_boost_usage) != ''
      AND db.operation.last IS NULL
      AND bq.timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
      AND bq.proto_payload.audit_log.method_name
        = 'google.cloud.bigquery.v2.JobService.InsertJob'
      AND bq.resource.type = 'bigquery_project'
      AND JSON_VALUE(
        bq.proto_payload.audit_log.metadata.jobInsertion.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.query)
        IS NOT NULL
      AND JSON_VALUE(db.labels.data_boost_workload_id)
        = REGEXP_EXTRACT(bq.proto_payload.audit_log.resource_name, '[^/]*$')
    GROUP BY bq_query
    ORDER BY usage DESC
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_NAME  ` with your project name.

The following example shows Data Boost usage by SQL text.
