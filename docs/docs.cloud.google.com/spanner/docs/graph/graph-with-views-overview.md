Use this document to learn about the benefits of using SQL views to create a graph. This document includes [benefits of creating graphs with views](#benefits-views-graphs) , [requirements](#requirements) , and [considerations](#views-considerations) to help you decide if you should use [tables](/spanner/docs/graph/create-update-drop-schema) or views to create a graph.

For details about how to create a graph from views, see [Create a property graph from SQL views](/spanner/docs/graph/graph-with-views-how-to) .

## Benefits of creating graphs with views instead of tables

A SQL *view* is a virtual table defined by a SQL query. In Spanner, the query defining a view executes every time a query that refers to the view executes. Spanner views aren't materialized views because they don't store the results of the query defining the view as an actual table in data storage. For more information, see [Views overview](/spanner/docs/views) . You can create graph elements from SQL views, but you can't create a view that queries a graph.

Views provide several advantages as an abstraction layer between tables and a graph schema that aren't available when you use tables to create a graph.

  - [**Row-level access control**](/spanner/docs/graph/graph-with-views-how-to#fine-grained-graph-access) . Apply [fine-grained access control](/spanner/docs/fgac-about) at the row-level to graph data using the security privileges of [definer's rights views](/spanner/docs/views#definer) . This ensures users can query only nodes and edges they are permitted to see.

  - **[Flexible data modeling](/spanner/docs/graph/graph-with-views-how-to#model-derived-graph)** . Use a view with a query to shape and transform relational data before creating a graph element. The view's query lets you filter rows, combine columns, or unnest repeated fields such as in an `  ARRAY  ` .

  - **[Transition from schemaless data to formalized data](/spanner/docs/graph/graph-with-views-how-to#schemaless-transition)** . Create views from [schemaless data](/spanner/docs/graph/manage-schemaless-data) to define node and edge types explicitly. This helps formalize the relationships in the data.

## Requirements for using views to create graphs

You must follow these requirements when you use views to create graph elements:

  - [Use the `  KEY  ` clause when you specify a graph element](#use-key-clause) .

  - [Use views that ensure nodes and edges are unique](#graph-view-requirements) .

### Use the `     KEY    ` clause when you specify a graph element

You must explicitly define the columns that uniquely identify the graph element when you use views to create a node or an edge element. To do this, use the `  KEY  ` clause in the node or edge element definition. To learn how to use the `  KEY  ` clause when creating a graph element, see the code examples in this document and in [Create a Spanner Graph from a SQL view](/spanner/docs/graph/graph-with-views-how-to) .

### Use views that ensure nodes and edges are unique

Views that define node or edge tables must follow one of the following patterns to ensure the nodes and edges are unique:

  - [Pattern 1](#pattern-1-view-pk) : The view uses a single table's primary key.

  - [Pattern 2](#pattern-2-group-by-distinct) : The view uses a `  GROUP BY  ` or a `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` clause.

You can use other SQL operators such as `  WHERE  ` , `  HAVING  ` , `  ORDER BY  ` , `  LIMIT  ` , and `  TABLESAMPLE  ` in combination with these patterns. These operators filter or order the results, but they don't change the underlying uniqueness guarantee that the patterns provide.

#### Pattern 1: Use a single table's primary key

In this pattern, the view selects from a single table, and the `  KEY  ` clause in the graph definition matches the base table's primary key columns. Because of this, each node or edge row produced by the view is unique.

For example, the following selects a subset of rows from the `  Account  ` table. The graph `  KEY(account_id)  ` matches the `  Account  ` table's primary key, which ensures that each row produced by the view is unique.

``` text
-- Table has PRIMARY KEY(account_id).
CREATE TABLE Account (
  account_id INT64 NOT NULL,
  customer_id INT64 NOT NULL,
  account_type STRING(MAX),
  balance INT64
) PRIMARY KEY(account_id);

-- Pattern 1: View uses the primary key from a single table.
CREATE VIEW SavingAccount
  SQL SECURITY INVOKER AS
    SELECT accnt.account_id, accnt.customer_id, accnt.balance
    FROM Account accnt
    WHERE accnt.account_type = 'saving';

CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH SavingAccountGraph
  NODE TABLES (
    -- The element KEY(account_id) matches the table's primary key.
    SavingAccount KEY(account_id)
  );
```

#### Pattern 2: Use `     GROUP BY    ` or `     SELECT DISTINCT    ` clause

In this pattern, the view's query uses a `  GROUP BY  ` or a `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` clause. The columns in the `  KEY  ` clause must match the columns that these clauses use to define uniqueness:

  - For `  GROUP BY  ` : The `  KEY  ` clause columns must match all columns in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause.

  - For `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` : The `  KEY  ` clause columns must match the columns in the `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` list.

Example with `  GROUP BY  ` :

``` text
CREATE TABLE Customer (
  customer_id INT64,
  name STRING(MAX)
) PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);

CREATE TABLE SaleOrder (
  order_id INT64,
  customer_id INT64,
  amount INT64
) PRIMARY KEY (order_id);

CREATE VIEW CustomerOrder
  SQL SECURITY INVOKER AS
    SELECT
      s.order_id,
      ANY_VALUE(c.customer_id) AS customer_id,
      ANY_VALUE(c.name) AS customer_name
    FROM Customer c JOIN SaleOrder s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
    GROUP BY s.order_id;

CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH OrderGraph
  NODE TABLES (
    -- The KEY(order_id) matches the GROUP BY column in view definition.
    CustomerOrder KEY(order_id)
  );
```

Example with `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` :

``` text
CREATE TABLE SaleOrder (
  order_id INT64,
  customer_id INT64,
  amount INT64
) PRIMARY KEY (order_id);

CREATE VIEW KeyCustomer SQL SECURITY INVOKER AS
  SELECT DISTINCT s.customer_id, s.amount
  FROM SaleOrder s
  WHERE s.amount > 1000;

CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH KeyCustomersGraph
  NODE TABLES (
    -- The KEY(customer_id, amount) matches the DISTINCT columns.
    KeyCustomer KEY(customer_id, amount)
  );
```

## Considerations when using views

When you use views to define graph elements, the following can help you design and implement an effective graph:

  - [Query performance evaluation](#query-performance) .

  - [Schema optimization](#schema-optimization) .

  - [Error handling to enforce data integrity](#error-handling) .

### Property graph query performance

When you define graph elements on views that perform data transformations (for example, `  GROUP BY  ` , `  UNNEST  ` , or `  JOIN  ` operations), carefully evaluate query performance for your use case. Remember that Spanner executes a view's query definition every time a query performs [element pattern matching](/spanner/docs/graph/queries-overview#graph-pattern-matching) .

### Graph schema optimization

When you use views to define graph elements, some [graph schema optimizations](/spanner/docs/graph/best-practices-designing-schema) might be less effective than when you use tables to define graph elements.

#### Views that project a single table's primary key

If a view is a projection from a single base table, any optimizations on that underlying table remain effective for graph queries. For example, applying the following techniques to base tables provides similar performance benefits for graph elements defined on such views:

  - [Optimize forward edge traversal](/spanner/docs/graph/best-practices-designing-schema#optimize-forward-edge-traversal) .

  - [Use referential constraints](/spanner/docs/graph/best-practices-designing-schema#use-ref-constraints) .

  - [Use secondary indexes to filter properties](/spanner/docs/graph/best-practices-designing-schema#use-secondary-indexes) .

#### Views defined with `     GROUP BY    ` or `     DISTINCT    ` clause

Views that perform aggregations, such as `  GROUP BY  ` , `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` , or other complex transformations, lose the direct relationship to the underlying table structure. Because of this, schema optimizations on the base tables might not provide the same performance benefits for graph queries that operate on the views. Carefully evaluate query performance for your use case when your views perform complex aggregations.

### Data modification with view-based graphs

Views are not materialized, which means they don't store the results of the query that defines the view as a table in data storage, and they are read-only. Because of this, to insert, update, or drop nodes or edges in a graph created from views, you modify data in the tables used to create the views.

### Graph error handling to enforce data integrity

When you use views to define graph elements, enforce data integrity (for example, enforce data types) on the underlying base tables. Otherwise, the data in the base tables might be invalid and cause queries on your view-based graph to fail at runtime.

For example, when you [transition from schemaless to a formalized graph](/spanner/docs/graph/graph-with-views-how-to#schemaless-transition) , use `  CHECK  ` constraints to validate data in your base tables ( `  GraphNode  ` and `  GraphEdge  ` ). The following code applies these constraints within the JSON properties to ensure data integrity at the source and prevent runtime query errors.

``` text
-- Enforce that the 'name' property exists for nodes with the 'person' label.
ALTER TABLE GraphNode
ADD CONSTRAINT NameMustExistForPersonConstraint
CHECK (IF(label = 'person', properties.name IS NOT NULL, TRUE));

-- Enforce that the 'name' property is a string for nodes with the 'person' label.
ALTER TABLE GraphNode
ADD CONSTRAINT PersonNameMustBeStringTypeConstraint
CHECK (IF(label = 'person', JSON_TYPE(properties.name) = 'string', TRUE));
```
