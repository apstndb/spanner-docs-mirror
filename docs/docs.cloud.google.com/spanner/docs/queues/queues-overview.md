Spanner queues provide transactional messaging to help you manage asynchronous work. The feature pairs this capability with the scalability and reliability of Spanner, letting you build event-driven applications. Spanner queues use a pull model for message consumption, exposing a SQL interface for receivers to request and receive messages.

## Choose between Spanner queues and change streams

The following comparison provides guidance on choosing the right mechanism for data propagation and asynchronous processing.

## Key advantages

Spanner queues offer several advantages:

  - **Integrated:** messaging is integrated into the database. This eliminates the need to provision, manage, and exfiltrate data to separate messaging infrastructure, which simplifies application architecture and lowers overall costs.
  - **Transactional:** you can send and acknowledge messages atomically within a Spanner transaction alongside other database writes. Enqueued messages are rolled back and not available for delivery if the transaction fails.
  - **Durable:** messages that can't be delivered are stored in the database. Spanner continually attempts delivery with backoff until the message is explicitly acknowledged or deleted.
  - **Queryable:** messages are built on the same primitives as Spanner tables and are stored as rows. You can query, join, or filter them like standard tables.
  - **Scalable:** built with the same scalability as Spanner tables, message processing scales alongside the rest of your database.
  - **Reliable:** Spanner queues inherit all of Spanner's high availability primitives, making message sending and processing fault-tolerant and resilient to zonal or regional failures.
  - **Schedulable:** messages can be scheduled for future delivery, allowing you to defer task execution to a specific future timestamp.
  - **Atomic:** message sending ( `INSERT` or mutation APIs) and acknowledgment ( `DELETE` or mutation APIs) execute atomically within transactions, ensuring consistency with database state.
  - **Extendable:** message leases can be extended to support extremely long processing times by combining future delivery and manual leasing mechanisms.

## Use cases

Spanner queues are useful for orchestrating deferred tasks within a transaction. Common examples include:

  - **Deferring computationally heavy work:** a photo-sharing website might need to perform intensive image processing when a new photo is uploaded. The transaction that writes the new photo metadata can simultaneously write a queue message. A queue receiver later picks up the message, performs the processing, and updates the metadata transactionally.
  - **Deferring large transactional updates:** in a calendar app, inviting a large group to a meeting in a single transaction can cause lock conflicts and tail latencies. Instead, the transaction that creates the calendar entry can add a queue entry for each invitee, allowing a receiver to send the invites individually.
  - **Scheduling tasks in the future:** a software as a service (SaaS) company offering a 30-day free trial can provision the user's resources and simultaneously queue a message scheduled to be delivered in 30 days. A worker then receives the message and executes the trial expiration logic.
  - **Deferring work to external systems:** after a user registers, an application might need to send a welcome email only if the database registration succeeds. The registration transaction can add an entry to a queue, allowing a worker to invoke an external email API later.
  - **Orchestrating multi-step pipelines:** in an order management system, fulfilling an order involves multiple steps that could fail independently. By representing each step as a queue message, the system can checkpoint the pipeline's state and continue from the point of failure.

## Workflow

A typical workflow for Spanner queues follows these steps:

  - **Create a queue:** define a queue using DDL, similar to a table. It must include a `Payload` column ( `payload` in PostgreSQL) and a primary key.
  - **Send messages:** enqueue messages using standard DML ( `INSERT` ) or mutation APIs, transactionally with other database operations.
  - **Receive messages:** use the `ExecuteStreamingSQL` API to call a table-valued function (TVF) named `RECEIVE_ QUEUE_NAME ()` . This function streams messages to your client as a long-running query.
  - **Process messages:** consume the messages received from the TVF with your application logic.
  - **Acknowledge messages:** remove messages from the queue using DML ( `DELETE` ) or mutation APIs (such as `ack` ). This is typically done after processing is complete, within a transaction.
  - **Manage leases:** manage message leases to ensure that Spanner queues don't redeliver messages on lease timeout. The most common method is to use the `RENEWLEASE_ QUEUE_NAME ()` TVF.

Additionally, keep in mind these core behaviors of Spanner queues:

  - **At-least-once delivery:** common to most cloud-based queue systems, Spanner promises at-least-once delivery. Redeliveries can be mitigated by extending leases.
  - **At-most-once acknowledgment:** because acknowledging a message happens over a transaction, Spanner [ACID semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) ensure that a message is only acknowledged once. Following the methods on the [Exactly-once processing and at-most-once acknowledgment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/queues/queues-exactly-once-processing) page to properly implement at-most-once acknowledgment.

## Limitations

Spanner queues have the following limitations:

  - **Maximum receivers:** there is a limit of 1000 active receive queries with the same arguments per queue
  - **Concurrent receive TVF quota limit:** there is a [quota limit](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/quotas#queue-limits) of 2000 concurrent receive TVFs per project per region. To increase the quota limit, fill out the [Request a Quota Increase for your Cloud Spanner project](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczQOE6S_1MUTf4KBpF_i-cJVMQloUEZQ71KcNQzbAkWDDuVw/viewform) form.
  - **Manual splitting:** the `AddSplits` API is not supported for queues. Workload distribution relies entirely on load-based splitting. Interleaving the queue in a table is recommended so that users can add split points to the table.
  - **Geo-partitioning compliance:** geo-partitioned queues are not data residency compliant after executing a `DROP PARTITION` operation.
  - **Queue count limits:** instances are limited to 100 queues for instances with 1 or more nodes. The limit scales down proportionally for granular instances (for example, instances with 200 processing units are limited to 20 queues).
  - **Dropping and recreating a queue:** dropping and recreating a queue of the same name isn't fully supported. The `RECEIVE` TVF for the queue may take time to "reset" before messages can be received at the same name again.
  - **PostgreSQL column naming:** Spanner exposes both the `deliver_time` and `DeliverTime` columns for the delivery time of a message. We recommend using the `deliver_time` column to align with standard PostgreSQL naming conventions, and because the `DeliverTime` column will be hidden from the information schema in a future release.
  - **Named schema:** queues cannot be created in named schemas.
