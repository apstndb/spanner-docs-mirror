This document describes how to use Spanner queues. It explains how to create a queue, send and receive messages, extend message leases, and acknowledge messages. It also includes best practices, information on monitoring queues, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Create a queue

To create a queue, use the `CREATE QUEUE` statement.

### GoogleSQL

    -- Example table for interleaving
    CREATE TABLE Users (
      UserId   INT64 NOT NULL,
      UserName STRING(MAX)
    ) PRIMARY KEY (UserId);
    
    -- Queue for processing user-related tasks
    -- NOTE: Queues do not have to be interleaved, but for locality and
    -- pre-warming purposes, it's recommended if you are inserting into a table
    -- and a queue simultaneously.
    CREATE QUEUE UserTasks (
      UserId     INT64 NOT NULL,
      MessageId  STRING(36) NOT NULL, -- UUID recommended
      Payload    BYTES(MAX) NOT NULL  -- Also: Proto, JSON, String are possible.
    ) PRIMARY KEY (UserId, MessageId),
    INTERLEAVE IN PARENT Users ON DELETE CASCADE;

### PostgreSQL

    -- Example table for interleaving
    CREATE TABLE users (
      userid   bigint NOT NULL,
      username varchar,
      PRIMARY KEY (userid)
    );
    
    -- Queue for processing user-related tasks
    -- NOTE: Queues do not have to be interleaved, but for locality and
    -- pre-warming purposes, it's recommended if you are inserting into a table
    -- and a queue simultaneously.
    CREATE QUEUE usertasks (
      userid     bigint NOT NULL,
      messageid  varchar(36) NOT NULL, -- UUID recommended
      payload    bytea NOT NULL, -- Also: text, varchar, jsonb are possible.
      PRIMARY KEY (userid, messageid)
    ) INTERLEAVE IN PARENT users ON DELETE CASCADE;

The only column that doesn't need to be explicitly created in the `CREATE QUEUE` statement is called `DeliverTime` in GoogleSQL and `deliver_time` in PostgreSQL. They are automatically created by Spanner.

Queues support [time to live (TTL) policies](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/ttl) , which can help to manage the message backlog for old, unacknowledged messages.

## Send a message

To send a message to a queue, use the [`INSERT` DML](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#insert-statement) statement:

### GoogleSQL

    -- Send message immediately
    INSERT INTO Users (UserId) VALUES (123);
    INSERT INTO UserTasks (UserId, MessageId, Payload, DeliverTime)
    VALUES (123, 'some-unique-id-1', b'Your task payload here', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP());
    
    -- Schedule a message delivery
    INSERT INTO UserTasks (UserId, MessageId, Payload, DeliverTime)
    VALUES (123, 'some-unique-id-2', b'Scheduled task', TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR));

### PostgreSQL

    -- Send message immediately
    INSERT INTO users (userid) VALUES (123);
    INSERT INTO usertasks (userid, messageid, payload, deliver_time)
    VALUES (123, 'some-unique-id-1', CAST('Your task payload here' AS bytea), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
    
    -- Schedule a message delivery
    INSERT INTO usertasks (userid, messageid, payload, deliver_time)
    VALUES (123, 'some-unique-id-2', CAST('Scheduled task' AS bytea), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL '1 HOUR');

Alternatively use the client library `Send` mutations for inserting a message:

### Go

    m := spanner.Send("UserTasks", spanner.Key{int64(123), "some-unique-id-1"}, []byte("Your task payload here"), spanner.WithDeliveryTime(futureTime))
    _, err := client.Apply(ctx, []*spanner.Mutation{m})

### Java

    dbClient.write(
            Collections.singletonList(
                Mutation.newSendBuilder("UserTasks")
                    .setKey(Key.of(123L, "some-unique-id-1"))
                    .setPayload(Value.bytes(ByteArray.copyFrom("message3")))
                    .setDeliveryTime(futureTime)
                    .build()));

## Receive messages

Use the `RECEIVE_ QUEUE_NAME ()` table-valued function (TVF) with `ExecuteStreamingSQL` to receive messages. This is a long-running call. You must execute one of these calls per worker, per queue, in a looping manner. Execute the query using a [strong read](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reads#read_types) because Spanner rejects stale reads.

### GoogleSQL

    -- SQL query to stream messages
    SELECT
      UserId,
      MessageId,
      Payload,
      DeliverTime,
      SpannerLeaseExpirationTimestamp,
      SpannerLeaseToken
    FROM RECEIVE_UserTasks(max_duration=>'20m');

### PostgreSQL

    -- SQL query to stream messages
    SELECT
      userid,
      messageid,
      payload,
      deliver_time,
      spanner_lease_expiration_timestamp,
      spanner_lease_token
    FROM spanner.receive_usertasks(NULL, NULL, '20m');

Your client code should iterate through the results using a streaming query. Each returned row is a message.

## Receive messages in a batch

To increase throughput by processing multiple messages together, you can receive messages in batches by specifying the `max_batch_size` argument:

### GoogleSQL

    -- SQL query to stream messages
    SELECT
      UserId,
      MessageId,
      Payload,
      DeliverTime,
      SpannerLeaseExpirationTimestamp,
      SpannerLeaseToken,
      SpannerLastBatchMessage -- Special boolean column returns TRUE if the
                              -- last message is in a batch.
    FROM RECEIVE_UserTasks(max_duration=>'20m', max_batch_size=>20);

### PostgreSQL

    -- SQL query to stream messages
    SELECT
      userid,
      messageid,
      payload,
      deliver_time,
      spanner_lease_expiration_timestamp,
      spanner_lease_token,
      spanner_last_batch_message -- Special boolean column returns TRUE if the
                                 -- last message is in a batch.
    FROM spanner.receive_usertasks(20, NULL, '20m');

Alternatively, use the client library. This Go example demonstrates how to stream messages from a queue, verify lease expiration, and acknowledge messages asynchronously:

    // import "cloud.google.com/go/spanner"
    // import "google.golang.org/api/iterator"
    
    stmt := spanner.Statement{SQL: "SELECT * FROM RECEIVE_UserTasks(max_duration=>'20m')"}
    iter := client.Single().Query(ctx, stmt)
    defer iter.Stop()
    
    for {
        row, err := iter.Next()
        if err == iterator.Done {
            break // Or potentially restart the query
        }
        if err != nil {
            // Handle error
            return err
        }
    
        var userId int64
        var messageId string
        var payload []byte
        var deliverTime time.Time
        var leaseExpiration time.Time
        var leaseToken string
        var lastBatchMessage bool
    
        if err := row.Columns(&userId, &messageId, &payload, &deliverTime, &leaseExpiration, &leaseToken, &lastBatchMessage); err != nil {
            // Handle column parsing error
            return err
        }
    
        if time.Now().After(leaseExpiration) {
            log.Printf("Lease expired for message %s, skipping", messageId)
            continue
        }
    
        // Process and acknowledge the message asynchronously so that we don't
        // block receiving subsequent messages.
        go func(userId int64, messageId string, payload []byte) {
            // Process the message (payload)
            // ... potentially long-running work ...
            // Need to extend the lease if processing is long
    
            // Acknowledge the message upon success
            _, err := client.Apply(ctx, []*spanner.Mutation{
                spanner.Ack("UserTasks", spanner.Key{userId, messageId}),
            })
            if err != nil {
                // Handle ack error
            }
        }(userId, messageId, payload)
    }

## Extend the message lease

If processing a message takes longer than the initial lease (10 seconds), use the following syntax:

### GoogleSQL

    -- Extends the lease and returns new expiration time lease_token.
    -- The lease will be extended by 10s (not configurable).
    SELECT * FROM RENEWLEASE_UserTasks(lease_tokens => ['token1', ..., 'tokenN'])
    
    -- Returns rows of tokens and whether they were successfully extended
    SpannerOldLeaseToken   SpannerNewLeaseToken  SpannerLeaseExpirationTimestamp
            <old_token1>           <new_token1>  "2025-09-27T12:10:00.0Z"
                'token2'                 <NULL>  "2025-09-27T12:09:51.0Z"
    ...
                'tokenN'           'tokenN_new'  "2025-09-27T12:10:01.0Z"

### PostgreSQL

    -- Extends the lease and returns new expiration time lease_token.
    -- The lease will be extended by 10s (not configurable).
    SELECT * FROM spanner.renewlease_usertasks(lease_tokens => ARRAY['token1', ..., 'tokenN'])
    
    -- Returns rows of tokens and whether they were successfully extended
    spanner_old_lease_token   spanner_new_lease_token  spanner_lease_expiration_timestamp
               <old_token1>              <new_token1>  "2025-09-27T12:10:00.0Z"
                   'token2'                    <NULL>  "2025-09-27T12:09:51.0Z"
    ...
                   'tokenN'              'tokenN_new'  "2025-09-27T12:10:01.0Z"

Lease tokens are returned according to the following logic:

1.  Unparseable lease tokens don't return a row.
2.  Already expired lease tokens don't return a row.
3.  Un-renewable lease tokens *do* return a row with a `SpannerNewLeaseToken` of NULL. This can occur if the message was already acknowledged but the lease token has not expired.

Alternatively, use the client library. This Go example demonstrates how to extend a message lease:

    // Inside message processing loop...
    
    // Before leaseExpiration, for example, in a separate goroutine or timed check
    // leaseToken is from the SELECT query
    extendStmt := spanner.Statement{
        SQL: "SELECT * FROM RENEWLEASE_UserTasks(lease_tokens => [@token1])",
        Params: map[string]interface{}{
            "token1": leaseToken,
        },
    }
    _, err := client.Single().Query(ctx, extendStmt).Next() // Simplified call
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Failed to extend lease for %s: %v", messageId, err)
        // Processing should probably stop as redelivery is likely
    } else {
        // New lease expiration is typically approximately 10s from now
        log.Printf("Lease extended for %s", messageId)
        // Update local leaseExpiration time if needed
    }

## Acknowledge a message

Use the [`DELETE` DML](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/dml-syntax#delete-statement) to acknowledge a message. This must be transactional with any other writes related to the message processing.

### GoogleSQL

    -- DML for acknowledging
    DELETE FROM UserTasks WHERE UserId = @userId AND MessageId = @messageId ASSERT_ROWS_MODIFIED 1;

### PostgreSQL

    -- DML for acknowledging
    DELETE FROM usertasks WHERE userid = $1 AND messageid = $2 ASSERT_ROWS_MODIFIED 1;

Alternatively, use the client library `Ack` mutation for acknowledging a message:

### Go

    _, err := client.Apply(ctx, []*spanner.Mutation{
        spanner.Ack("UserTasks", spanner.Key{1}),
    })

### Java

    dbClient.write(
        Collections.singletonList(
            Mutation.newAckBuilder("UserTasks")
                .setKey(Key.of(2L))
                .build()));

## Best practices

The following are best practices for using Spanner queues:

  - **Small payloads:** keep queue message payloads small under 4 KB. Use the [out-of-band storage pattern](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/queues/queues-examples#handle_large_message_payloads) for larger data.
  - **Lease management:** extend leases for tasks that might exceed the default message lease of 10 seconds. Failure to extend message leases can cause redeliveries and potential double processing.
  - **Error handling:** Spanner queues retry messages that fail processing with back-off within the first hour, and older messages will be retried once per hour. Consider moving messages that fail permanently to a separate queue.
  - **Monitoring:** monitor queue depths and oldest unacknowledged message age to ensure your receivers aren't limiting your pipeline intake.
  - **Idempotency:** design your message processors to tolerate repeat operations, because at-least-once delivery means occasional duplicates are possible. See the [Exactly-once processing and at-most-once acknowledgment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/queues/queues-exactly-once-processing) page for more information.
  - **Table-value function duration:** avoid both extremely short and excessively long durations for table-valued functions. A moderate duration, such as 20 minutes, is recommended.
  - **Batch sizing:** tune `max_batch_size` to your workload. Use smaller batches for high fan-out events to avoid lock contention on shared rows. Use larger batches for independent, high queries-per-second tasks. Acknowledge or extend message leases for a batch in a single transaction for the best performance.

## Monitor

You can monitor queue operations using Spanner introspection tables. Although these tables don't include queue-specific columns, you can identify queue activity by searching for your user-defined queue names in the following tables:

  - [Read statistics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/read-statistics)
  - [Transaction statistics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/transaction-statistics)
  - [Lock statistics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/lock-statistics)
  - [Table sizes statistics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/table-sizes-statistics)
  - [Table operations statistics](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/introspection/table-operations-statistics)

The following Spanner queue metrics are found under the `spanner.googleapis.com/queue/*` prefix in [Cloud Monitoring](https://docs.cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs) :

  - `buffered_ready_messages` : (GAUGE, INT64, 1) The count of messages that are held in memory and are ready for delivery to a receiver.
  - `message_send_count` : (DELTA, INT64, 1) The number of messages sent in Spanner during the interval for a queue.
  - `message_ack_count` : (DELTA, INT64, 1) The number of messages acknowledged in Spanner during the interval for a queue.
  - `oldest_unacked_message_age` : (GAUGE, INT64, 1) The age (in seconds) of the oldest unacknowledged message in a queue.
  - `lease_expiration_count` : (DELTA, INT64, 1) The number of lease expirations in Spanner during the interval for a queue.

All of the previous metrics are sampled approximately every 60 seconds. After sampling, data may not be visible for up to 120 seconds. [Spanner audit logging](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/audit-logging) covers writes, reads, and schema operations on queues.

## Troubleshoot

The following sections describe how to identify and resolve common issues when using Spanner queues.

### Message backlog is growing

#### Diagnosis

Both `oldest_unacked_message_age` and `buffered_ready_messages` are elevated. This indicates an imbalance between your message send rate and your application's message processing capacity.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, do the following:

  - **Check the acknowledgment rate:** if the `message_ack_count` metric has dropped, check your client workers to ensure that they are running properly and haven't stalled or crashed.
  - **Check the send rate:** if `message_send_count` has spiked, scale up message processing workers to handle the increased load.
  - **Confirm resource exhaustion:** check whether `buffered_ready_messages` and `lease_expiration_count` counts are elevated. This combination indicates a shortage of active table-valued function (TVF) receivers or slow client processing.

### Individual messages are stuck

#### Diagnosis

The `oldest_unacked_message_age` metric is high, but `buffered_ready_messages` is low or stable. This indicates that individual messages are failing to process or acknowledge rather than an overall capacity bottleneck.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, do the following:

  - **Identify stuck messages:** query the queue table and order results by delivery time to find the oldest unacknowledged messages:
    
    ### GoogleSQL
    
        SELECT *
        FROM UserTasks
        ORDER BY DeliverTime ASC
        LIMIT 10;
    
    ### PostgreSQL
    
        SELECT *
        FROM usertasks
        ORDER BY deliver_time ASC
        LIMIT 10;

  - **Investigate processing failures:** check your application logs to determine why workers aren't acknowledging the identified messages. Unacknowledged messages are automatically redelivered after their lease expires.

### Message leases expire before processing completes

#### Diagnosis

The `lease_expiration_count` metric is elevated or increasing. This indicates that message processing time exceeds the lease duration (default 10 seconds) before workers can acknowledge the messages.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, do the following:

  - **Renew leases proactively:** if message processing takes longer than 10 seconds, call the `RENEWLEASE_ QUEUE_NAME ()` TVF periodically. Renew the lease approximately 7-8 seconds into processing to safely account for network latency.
  - **Investigate slow processing:** if your application already renews leases actively but `lease_expiration_count` remains high, check your backend code for processing bottlenecks, slow RPC calls, or deadlocks.

### Cannot scale the message send rate

#### Diagnosis

The `message_send_count` metric reaches a throughput plateau or publishing requests encounter elevated write latency when you attempt to increase the send rate.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, consider the following structural changes:

  - **Scale up compute resources:** add nodes or processing units to your Spanner instance to increase overall database capacity.
  - **Check splits:** evaluate whether you can add more splits to distribute the write load across multiple servers.
  - **Optimize routing:** ensure that your publishing application writes directly to the leader region of your Spanner instance to minimize write latency.

### Ready messages are not being processed

#### Diagnosis

The `buffered_ready_messages` metric is high and increasing. This indicates that messages are buffered and ready for delivery in memory, but receiver workers aren't pulling them.

#### Resolution

To resolve this issue, do the following:

  - **Check active TVF connections:** check your active receiver TVF count to ensure that reader workers are actively connecting and pulling messages. If workers have disconnected or aren't running enough concurrent `RECEIVE_ QUEUE_NAME ()` queries, messages remain unpolled in the buffer.
