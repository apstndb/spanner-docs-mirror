title: Information schema for PostgreSQL-dialect databases
description: Query the information_schema and spanner_sys schemas in Spanner PostgreSQL-dialect databases to retrieve database metadata.
data_source: docs.cloud.google.com
---

The information schema is a built-in schema that's common to every PostgreSQL database. You can run SQL queries against tables in the `information_schema` to fetch schema metadata for a database.

For example, the following query fetches the names of all user-defined tables in a database:

```
  SELECT
    table_schema,
    table_name
  FROM
    information_schema.tables
  WHERE
    table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema', 'SPANNER_SYS')
    AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
```

## Usage

- `information_schema` tables are available only through SQL interfaces, for example:

  - The `executeQuery` API
  - The `gcloud spanner databases execute-sql` command
  - The **Query** page of a database in the Google Cloud console.

  Other single read methods don't support `information_schema` .

<!-- -->

- Queries against the `information_schema` can use strong, bounded staleness, or exact staleness [timestamp bounds](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/timestamp-bounds) .
- If you are using a GoogleSQL-dialect database, see [Information schema for GoogleSQL-dialect databases](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/information-schema) .

## Differences from `information_schema` for PostgreSQL

The tables in the `information_schema` for PostgreSQL-dialect databases include columns from the tables in the `information_schema` for open source PostgreSQL and in some cases also include columns from Spanner. In these tables, the open source PostgreSQL columns come first and in the same order as they do for a open source PostgreSQL database, and any distinct columns for Spanner are appended afterwards. Queries written for the open source PostgreSQL version of `information_schema` should work without modification when using PostgreSQL-dialect databases in Google Cloud CLI.

> **Note:** Queries against the `information_schema` for PostgreSQL-dialect databases that use `select *` and reference columns by offset might not work the same as they do against open source PostgreSQL databases. The GoogleSQL-specific columns can shift in position if PostgreSQL adds new columns to an `information_schema` table.

Other notable differences in the `information_schema` for PostgreSQL-dialect databases are:

- Some of the table columns for open source PostgreSQL are available, but not populated in PostgreSQL-dialect databases.
- PostgreSQL-dialect databases use `public` for the default schema name.
- Automatically generated constraint names use a different format than open source PostgreSQL databases.
- Tables related to open source PostgreSQL features that are not supported in PostgreSQL-dialect databases are not available.
- Some tables that are available with Spanner but not open source PostgreSQL, such as `database_options` , `index_columns` , `indexes` , and `spanner_statistics` are available.

## Row filtering in `information_schema` tables and views

Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` [system role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/fgac-system-roles) (or to members of that role) can see all rows in all `information_schema` tables and views. For other principals, Spanner filters rows based on the current database role. The table and view descriptions in the following sections indicate how Spanner filters rows for each table and view.

## Tables in `information_schema` for PostgreSQL-dialect databases

The tables and views in the `information_schema` are compatible with the tables and views in the `information_schema` of open source PostgreSQL.

The following sections describe the tables and views in the `information_schema` for PostgreSQL-dialect databases.

### `applicable_roles`

This row-filtered view lists all role memberships that are explicitly granted to all database roles. Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only the role memberships that are granted to the current database role or to a role of which the current database role is a member.

Because all database roles are members of the [public role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/fgac-system-roles#public) , the results omit records for implicit membership in the public role.

| **Column name** | **Type**            | **Description**                                                           |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grantee`       | `character varying` | The name of the database role to which membership is granted.             |
| `role_name`     | `character varying` | The name of the parent database role in which this membership is granted. |
| `is_grantable`  | `character varying` | Not used. Always `NO` .                                                   |

### `change_stream_columns`

This row-filtered view contains information about table columns and the change streams that watch them. Each row describes one change stream and one column. If a change stream tracks an entire table, then the columns in that table don't show in this view.

Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only rows for change streams on which the `SELECT` privilege is granted to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

| Column name             | Type                | Description                                                                                         |

| `column_name`           | `character varying` | The name of the column that this row refers to.                                                     |

### `change_stream_options`

This row-filtered view contains the configuration options for change streams. Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only options for change streams on which the `SELECT` privilege is granted to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

| Column name             | Type                | Description                                                                                         |

| `option_type`           | `character varying` | The data type of the change stream option.                                                          |
| `option_value`          | `character varying` | The value of the change stream option.                                                              |

### `change_stream_privileges`

This row-filtered view lists all fine-grained access control privileges granted on all change streams to any database role, including `public` . Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only privileges granted on change streams to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

| **Column name**         | **Type**            | **Description**                                                                                                   |

### `change_stream_tables`

This row-filtered view contains information about tables and the change streams that watch them. Each row describes one table and one change stream. Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only rows for change streams on which the `SELECT` privilege is granted to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

The data in `change_stream_tables` does not include the implicit relationships between tables and change streams that track the entire database.

### `change_streams`

This row-filtered view lists all of a database's change streams, and notes which ones track the entire database versus specific tables or columns. Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only change streams on which the `SELECT` fine-grained access control privilege is granted to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

### `columns`

This row-filtered view provides information about all table columns and view columns in the database. Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only columns that have any fine-grained access control privileges granted on them (or the `SELECT` , `INSERT` or `UPDATE` privileges granted on their containing tables) to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

### `parameters`

This row-filtered view defines the arguments for each user defined and change stream read function. Each row describes one argument for one user defined or change stream read function.

Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only parameters for user defined and change stream read functions on which the `EXECUTE` fine-grained access control privilege is granted to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

### `referential_constraints`

This view contains one row about each `FOREIGN KEY` constraint. You can see only those constraints for which you have write access to the referencing table. This view also identifies the `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` constraints on the referenced tables that the foreign keys use for constraint enforcement and referential actions.

### `table_privileges`

This row-filtered view lists all fine-grained access control privileges granted on all tables and views to any database role, including `public` . Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all rows in this view. All other principals can see only privileges granted on tables and views to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .

### `tables`

This row-filtered view lists all the tables and view that are in the current database. Principals that have database-level IAM permissions and principals who have been granted access to the `spanner_info_reader` system role or to members of that role can see all tables and views. All other principals can see only tables that meet either of the following requirements:

- The `SELECT` , `INSERT` , `UPDATE` , or `DELETE` fine-grained access control privileges are granted on the table to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .
- The `SELECT` , `INSERT` , or `UPDATE` privileges are granted on any table column to the current database role, to roles of which the current database role is a member, or to `public` .
