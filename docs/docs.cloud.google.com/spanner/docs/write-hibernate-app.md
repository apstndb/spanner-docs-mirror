Hibernate is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. To write a simple Hibernate application that connects to Spanner, try the [Spanner with Hibernate ORM codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-spanner-hibernate) .

For more information about integrating databases with Hibernate, see the following:
