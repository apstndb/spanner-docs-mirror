This page describes the different types of instance configurations available in Spanner, and the differences and trade-offs between them.

## Instance configurations

A Spanner instance configuration defines the geographic placement and replication of the databases in that instance. When you create an instance, you must configure it as either *regional* , *dual-region* , or *multi-region* . You make this choice by selecting an instance configuration, which determines where your data is stored for that instance:

  - [Regional configurations](#regional-configurations) : all the resources reside within a single Google Cloud region
  - [Dual-region configurations](#dual-region-configurations) : all resources span two regions and reside within a single country (available in the [Enterprise Plus edition](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) )
  - [Multi-region configurations](#multi-region-configurations) : the resources span more than two regions (available in the [Enterprise Plus edition](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) )

For more information about region-specific considerations, see [Geography and regions](/docs/geography-and-regions#regions_and_zones) .

The instance configurations with predefined regions and replication topologies are referred to as **base instance configurations** . You can create **custom instance configurations** and add additional optional read-only replicas to a predefined base instance configuration (available in the [Enterprise edition and Enterprise Plus edition](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) ). The added read-only replica must be in a region that isn't part of the existing instance configuration. For a list of the optional read-only regions that you can add, see the Optional Region column under [Regional available configurations](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#available-configurations-regional) and [Multi-region available configurations](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#available-configurations-multi-region) . You can't change the replication topology of base instance configurations. For more information, see [Read-only replicas](/spanner/docs/replication#read-only) .

You can [move your instance](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#move-instance) from any instance configuration to any other regional, dual-region or multi-region instance configuration (for example, from `  regional-us-central1  ` to `  nam3  ` ). You can also [create a new custom instance configuration with additional replicas](/spanner/docs/create-manage-configurations#create-configuration) , then move your instance to the new custom instance configuration. For example, if your instance is in `  regional-us-central1  ` and you want to add a read-only replica `  us-west1  ` , then you need to create a new custom instance configuration with `  regional-us-central1  ` as the base configuration and add `  us-west1  ` as a read-only replica. Then, move your instance to this new custom instance configuration.

## Regional configurations

Google Cloud services are available in [locations](/about/locations) across North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. If your users and services are located within a single region, choose a regional instance configuration for the lowest-latency reads and writes.

For any base regional configuration, Spanner maintains three [read-write replicas](/spanner/docs/replication#read-write) , each within a different Google Cloud [zone](/docs/geography-and-regions) in that region. Each read-write replica contains a full copy of your operational database that is able to serve read-write and read-only requests. Spanner uses replicas in different zones so that if a single-zone failure occurs, your database remains available.

### Available configurations

Spanner offers the following base regional instance configurations. To request an optional read-only replica region that isn't listed in the following table, [fill out this request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw9Rj4p4KA8oLu7MhIpSyPRd-4qxqazwsFZIY-_tkNrpWFcw/viewform) . Note that we use these requests to gauge demand for future regions and may not respond directly to your submission.

### Replication

Base regional configurations contain three [read-write replicas](/spanner/docs/replication#read-write) . Every Spanner mutation requires a write quorum that's composed of a majority of voting replicas. Write quorums are formed from two out of the three replicas in regional configurations. For more information about leader regions and voting replicas, see [Replication](/spanner/docs/replication) .

You can [create a custom regional instance configuration](/spanner/docs/create-manage-configurations#create-configuration) and add optional read-only replicas. Read-only replicas can help scale reads and support low latency stale reads. These read-only replicas don't take part in the write quorums. The replicas don't affect the [Spanner \>= 99.99% SLA](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/sla) for regional instances. You can add locations listed under the Optional Region column as optional read-only replica(s). If you don't see your chosen read-only replica location, you can [request a new optional read-only replica region](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw9Rj4p4KA8oLu7MhIpSyPRd-4qxqazwsFZIY-_tkNrpWFcw/viewform) . For more information, see [Read-only replicas](/spanner/docs/replication#read-only) .

### Performance best practices for regional configurations

For optimal performance, follow these best practices:

  - [Design a schema](/spanner/docs/schema-design) that prevents hotspots and other performance issues.
  - Place critical compute resources within the same region as your Spanner instance.
  - Provision enough [compute capacity](/spanner/docs/compute-capacity) to keep high priority total CPU utilization under 65%.
  - For information about the amount of throughput per Spanner node, see [Performance for regional configurations](/spanner/docs/performance) .

## Dual-region configurations

**Note:** Dual-region configurations are available with the Spanner Enterprise Plus edition. For more information, see the [Spanner editions overview](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) .

Dual-region configurations let you replicate the database's data in multiple zones across two regions in a single country, as defined by the instance configuration.

Dual-region configurations do the following:

  - Serve reads from two regions in a single country.
  - Meet data residency requirements.
  - Provide higher availability and SLAs than regional configurations.

Spanner offers dual-region configurations in Australia, Germany, India, and Japan.

For information about the amount of throughput per Spanner node, see [Performance for dual-region configurations](/spanner/docs/performance#dual-region-performance) .

### Benefits

Dual-region instances offer these primary benefits:

  - **99.999% availability** : across two regions in the same country, which is greater than the 99.99% availability that Spanner regional configurations provide.

  - **Data distribution** : automatically replicates your data between the two regions with strong consistency guarantees.

  - **Data residency requirements** : Meets data residency requirements in the countries listed under dual-region [Available configurations](#available-configurations-dual) .

### Replication

A dual-region contains six replicas, three in each region. One of the regions is designated as the default leader region (listed in the previous table). You can [change the leader region of a database](/spanner/docs/modifying-leader-region#changing_the_leader_region_of_a_db) . In each region, there are two read-write replicas and one [witness replica](/spanner/docs/replication#witness) . When both regions are healthy and running in a dual-region configuration, the quorum is established across all six replicas. A minimum of two replicas in each region is required to form a quorum and commit a transaction.

### Failover and failback

After you create a dual-region configuration, you can view the *Dual-region quorum health timeline* metric on the [System insights](/spanner/docs/monitoring-console) dashboard. This metric is only available for dual-region configurations. It shows the health of three quorums:

  - The dual-region quorum: `  Global  `
  - The single region quorum in each region (for example, `  Sydney  ` and `  Melbourne  ` )

It shows an orange bar in the timeline when there is service disruption. You can hover over it to see the start and end times of the disruption.

For faster recovery time objective (RTO), we recommend monitoring or setting up an alert on the dual-region quorum health timeline metric. This metric helps you make self-managed, when-to-failover decisions in case of regional failures. After you trigger instance failover, the failover usually completes within one minute.

Spanner also supports automatic, Google-managed failovers, which might take up to 45 minutes from the time the failure is first detected. The longer RTO is due to Google's service-wide monitoring. We need to gather additional signals to verify that the entire region is disrupted and validate that there is region-level impact. This also ensures that a failover results in better overall service for users in the configuration.

To failover and failback manually, see [Change dual-region quorum](/spanner/docs/change-dual-region-quorum) .

Consider the following when making manual failover and failback decisions:

  - If all three quorums are healthy, then no action is needed.

  - If one of the regions shows disruption, then there is probably a regional service disruption. This might cause the databases running in your dual-region quorum to experience less availability. Writes might also fail because a quorum can't be established and transactions eventually time out. Using the System insights dashboard, observe error rates and latency in your database. If there are increased error rates or latency, then we recommend that you *failover* , which means changing the dual-region quorum from dual-region to the region that is still healthy. After the disrupted region is healthy again, you must *failback* , changing the dual-region quorum from single region to dual-region. Google automatically performs failover and failback when it detects a regional outage. You can also manually failover if you detect a disruption. However, you must remember to manually failback if you performed a manual failover.

  - If the dual-region quorum shows disruption even though both single regions are healthy, then there is a network partitioning issue. The two regions are no longer able to communicate with each other so they each show healthy even though the overall system is not. In this scenario, we recommend that you failover to the default leader region. After the network partition issue is resolved and the dual-region quorum returns to healthy, you must manually failback.

Dual-region provides zero recovery point objective (RPO) because there is no data loss during a regional outage or when a network partition issue arises.

To check the mode (single or dual) of your dual-region quorum, see [Check dual-region quorum](/spanner/docs/change-dual-region-quorum#check) .

#### Failover and failback best practices

Failover and failback best practices include:

  - Don't failover to a single region if no region failures or disruptions occur. Failing over to a single region increases the possibility of overall system unavailability if that single region fails.
  - Be mindful when selecting the region to failover. Choosing a wrong region to failover results in database unavailability, which is unrecoverable before the region is back online. To verify, you can use a [bash script](/spanner/docs/change-dual-region-quorum#rest-gcloud) to check the health of your single region, before performing the failover.
  - If the unhealthy region is the default leader region, [change the default leader region](/spanner/docs/modifying-leader-region#change-leader-region) to the failover region after performing the failover. After confirming both regions are healthy again, perform failback, then change the leader region back to your original leader region.
  - Remember to manually failback if you performed a manual failover.

### Limitations

You can't create a custom dual-region instance configuration. You can't add read-only replicas to a dual-region instance configuration.

## Multi-region configurations

**Note:** Multi-region configurations are available with the Spanner Enterprise Plus edition. For more information, see the [Spanner editions overview](/spanner/docs/editions-overview) .

Spanner regional configurations replicate data between multiple zones within a single region. However, a regional configuration might not be optimal if:

  - Your application often needs to read data from multiple geographic locations (for example, to serve data to users in both North America and Asia).
  - Your writes originate from a different location than your reads (for example, if you have large write workloads in North America and large read workloads in Europe).

Multi-region configurations can:

  - Serve writes from multiple regions.
  - Maintain availability in the case of regional failures.
  - Provide higher availability and SLAs than regional configurations.

Multi-region configurations let you replicate your databases in multiple zones across multiple regions, as defined by the instance configuration. Each multi-region configuration contains two read-write regions. A read-write region contains two read-write replicas located in separate zones. These replicas let you read data with lower latency from multiple locations close to or within the regions in the configuration.

There are trade-offs though, because in a multi-region configuration, the quorum (read-write) replicas are spread across more than one region. You might notice additional network latency when these replicas communicate with each other to form a write quorum. Reads don't require a quorum. The result is that your application achieves faster reads in more places at the cost of a small increase in write latency. For more information, see [The role of replicas in writes and reads](/spanner/docs/replication#role-of-replicas) .

### Available configurations

Spanner offers the following base multi-region instance configurations. To request an optional read-only replica region that isn't listed in the following table, [fill out this request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw9Rj4p4KA8oLu7MhIpSyPRd-4qxqazwsFZIY-_tkNrpWFcw/viewform) .

  - *L* : default leader region. For more information, see [Modify the leader region of a database](/spanner/docs/modifying-leader-region) .

  - *1R* : one replica in the region.

  - *2R* : two replicas in the region.

  - *2RW+1W* : two read-write replicas and one witness replica in the region.

  - *1-OR* : one optional replica. You can create a custom regional instance configuration and add one optional read-only replica. For more information, see [Create a custom instance configuration](/spanner/docs/create-manage-configurations#create-configuration) .

  - *2-OR* : up to two optional replicas. You can create a custom regional instance configuration and add one or two optional read-only replicas. We recommend adding two (where possible) to help maintain low read latency. For more information, see [Create a custom instance configuration](/spanner/docs/create-manage-configurations#create-configuration) .

  - *A* : This instance configuration is restricted with an allow-list. To get access, reach out to your Technical Account Manager.

The resource location for a multi-region instance configuration determines the disaster recovery zone guarantee for the configuration. It defines where data is stored at-rest.

### Benefits

Multi-region instances offer these primary benefits:

  - **99.999% availability** , which is greater than the 99.99% availability that Spanner regional configurations provide.

  - **Data distribution** : Spanner automatically replicates your data between regions with strong consistency guarantees. This allows your data to be stored where it's used, which can reduce latency and improve the user experience.

  - **External consistency** : Even though Spanner replicates across geographically distant locations, you can still use Spanner as if it were a database running on a single machine. Transactions are guaranteed to be serializable, and the order of transactions within the database is the same as the order in which clients observe the transactions to have been committed. External consistency is a stronger guarantee than "strong consistency," which is offered by some other products. Read more about this property in [TrueTime and external consistency](/spanner/docs/true-time-external-consistency) .

### Replication

Each base multi-region configuration contains two regions that are designated as **read-write regions** , each of which contains two read-write replicas. One of these read-write regions is designated as the *default leader region* , which means that it contains your database's leader replicas. Spanner also places a witness replica in a third region called a **witness region** .

Each time a client issues a mutation to your database, a write quorum forms, consisting of one of the replicas from the default leader region and any two of the additional four voting replicas. (The quorum could be formed by replicas from two or three of the regions that make up your configuration, depending on which other replicas participate in the vote.) In addition to these five voting replicas, some base multi-region configurations contain read-only replicas for serving low-latency reads. The regions that contain read-only replicas are called **read-only regions** .

In general, the voting regions in a multi-region configuration are placed geographically close—less than a thousand miles apart—to form a low-latency quorum that enables fast writes ( [learn more](/spanner/docs/replication#aside-why-read-only-and-witness-replicas) ). However, the regions are still far enough apart—typically, at least a few hundred miles—to avoid coordinated failures. In addition, if your client application is in a non-leader region, Spanner uses leader-aware routing to route read-write transactions dynamically to reduce latency in your database. For more information, see [Leader-aware routing](/spanner/docs/leader-aware-routing) .

You can [create a custom multi-region instance configuration](/spanner/docs/create-manage-configurations#create-configuration) with optional read-only replicas. Any custom read-only replicas you create can't be included in write quorums. You can add locations listed under the Optional Region column as optional read-only replica(s). If you don't see your chosen read-only replica location, you can [request a new optional read-only replica region](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfw9Rj4p4KA8oLu7MhIpSyPRd-4qxqazwsFZIY-_tkNrpWFcw/viewform) . For more information, see [Read-only replicas](/spanner/docs/replication#read-only) .

**Note:** if you are interested in more detailed information about how data is replicated in Spanner, and about the different types of replicas and their roles in reads and writes, see [Replication](/spanner/docs/replication) .

### Performance best practices for multi-region configurations

For optimal performance, follow these best practices:

  - [Design a schema](/spanner/docs/schema-design) that prevents hotspots and other performance issues.
  - For optimal write latency, place compute resources for write-heavy workloads within or close to the default leader region.
  - For optimal read performance outside of the default leader region, use staleness of at least 15 seconds.
  - To avoid single-region dependency for your workloads, place critical compute resources in at least two regions. A good option is to place them next to the two different read-write regions so that any single region outage won't impact all of your application.
  - Provision enough [compute capacity](/spanner/docs/compute-capacity) to keep high priority total CPU utilization under 45% in each region.
  - For information about the amount of throughput per Spanner node, see [Performance for multi-region configurations](/spanner/docs/performance#multi-region-performance) .

## Move an instance

You can move your Spanner instance from any instance configuration to any other instance configuration, including between regional and multi-region configurations. Moving your instance does not cause downtime, and Spanner continues to provide the usual [transaction guarantees](/spanner/docs/transactions#rw_transaction_properties) , including strong consistency, during the move.

To learn more about Spanner instance move, see [Move an instance](/spanner/docs/move-instance) .

## Configure the default leader region

To change the location of your database's default leader region to be closer to connecting clients to reduce application latency, you can change the leader region for any Spanner instance that uses a dual-region or multi-region configuration. For instructions on changing the location of the leader region, see [Change the leader region of a database](/spanner/docs/modifying-leader-region#changing_the_leader_region_of_a_db) . The only regions eligible to become the default leader region for your database are the read-write regions in your [dual-region](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#available-configurations-dual) or [multi-region](/spanner/docs/instance-configurations#available-configurations-multi-region) configuration.

The leader region is responsible for handling all database writes, therefore if most of your traffic comes from one geographic region, you can move it to that region to reduce latency. Updating the default leader region is cheap and does not involve any data moves. The new value takes a few minutes to take effect.

**Note:** In the event that the default leader region fails or is not available, Spanner automatically places your database's leader replicas in the second read-write region of your instance configuration, ensuring high availability and no impact to your application.

Changing the default leader region is a [schema change](/spanner/docs/schema-updates) , which uses a long-running operation. If needed, you can [Get the status of the long-running operation](/spanner/docs/manage-long-running-operations#get_the_status_of_a_long-running_database_operation) .
