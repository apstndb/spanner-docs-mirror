This page describes the privileges that you can grant to a database role for fine-grained access control. This information applies to both GoogleSQL-dialect databases and PostgreSQL-dialect databases.

To learn about database roles and fine-grained access control, see [Fine-grained access control overview](/spanner/docs/fgac-about) .

The following table shows the fine-grained access control privileges and the database objects that they can be granted on.

The following sections provide details about each privilege.

## `     SELECT    `

Allows the role to read or query from a table, view, change stream, sequence, or model.

  - If a column list is specified for a table, the privilege is valid on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all columns in the table, including columns added afterward. A column list isn't allowed for a view.

  - Spanner supports both invoker's rights views and definer's rights views. For more information, see [Views overview](/spanner/docs/views) .
    
    If you create a view with invoker's rights, to query the view, the database role or user needs the `  SELECT  ` privilege on the view, and also the `  SELECT  ` privilege on the underlying objects referenced in the view. For example, suppose the view `  SingerNames  ` is created on the `  Singers  ` table.
    
    ``` text
    CREATE VIEW SingerNames SQL SECURITY INVOKER AS
    SELECT Singers.SingerId, Singers.FirstName, Singers.LastName FROM Singers;
    ```
    
    Suppose that the database role `  myRole  ` performs the query `  SELECT * FROM SingerNames  ` . The role must have `  SELECT  ` privilege on the view and must have `  SELECT  ` privilege on the three referenced columns or on the entire `  Singers  ` table.
    
    If you create a view with definer's rights, to query the view, the database role or user only needs the `  SELECT  ` privilege on the view. For example, suppose the view `  AlbumsBudget  ` is created on the `  Albums  ` table.
    
    ``` text
    CREATE VIEW AlbumsBudget SQL SECURITY DEFINER AS
    SELECT Albums.Id, Albums.AlbumTitle, MarketingBudget FROM Albums;
    ```
    
    Suppose that the database role `  Analyst  ` performs the query `  SELECT * FROM AlbumsBudget  ` . The role only needs `  SELECT  ` privilege on the view. It doesn't need the `  SELECT  ` privilege on the three referenced columns or on the `  Albums  ` table.

  - After granting `  SELECT  ` on a subset of columns for a table, the FGAC user can no longer use `  SELECT *  ` on that table. Queries on that table must name all columns to be included.

  - `  SELECT  ` granted on a generated column doesn't grant `  SELECT  ` on the underlying base columns.

  - For interleaved tables, `  SELECT  ` granted on the parent table doesn't propagate to the child table.

  - When you grant `  SELECT  ` on a change stream, you must also grant `  EXECUTE  ` on the table-valued function for the change stream. For more information, see [EXECUTE](#execute-privilege) .

  - When `  SELECT  ` is used with an aggregate function on specific columns, for example `  SUM(col_a)  ` , the role must have the `  SELECT  ` privilege on those columns. If the aggregate function doesn't specify any columns, for example `  COUNT(*)  ` , the role must have the `  SELECT  ` privilege on at least one column in the table.

  - When you use `  SELECT  ` with a sequence, you can only view sequences that you have privileges to view.

#### Examples for using `     GRANT SELECT    `

### GoogleSQL

``` text
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE employees TO ROLE hr_director;

GRANT SELECT ON TABLE customers, orders, items TO ROLE account_mgr;

GRANT SELECT(name, level, cost_center, location, manager) ON TABLE employees TO ROLE hr_manager;

GRANT SELECT(name, address, phone) ON TABLE employees, contractors TO ROLE hr_rep;

GRANT SELECT ON VIEW orders_view TO ROLE hr_manager;

GRANT SELECT ON CHANGE STREAM ordersChangeStream TO ROLE hr_analyst;

GRANT SELECT ON SEQUENCE sequence_name TO ROLE role_name;
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE employees TO hr_director;

GRANT SELECT ON TABLE customers, orders, items TO account_mgr;

GRANT SELECT(name, level, cost_center, location, manager) ON TABLE employees TO hr_manager;

GRANT SELECT(name, address, phone) ON TABLE employees, contractors TO hr_rep;

GRANT SELECT ON TABLE orders_view TO hr_manager; // orders_view is an invoker rights view

GRANT SELECT ON CHANGE STREAM orders_change_stream TO hr_analyst;

GRANT SELECT ON SEQUENCE sequence_name TO hr_package;
```

## `     INSERT    `

Allows the role to insert rows into the specified tables. If a column list is specified, the permission is valid on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all columns in the table.

  - If column names are specified, any column not included gets its default value upon insert.

  - `  INSERT  ` can't be granted on generated columns.

#### Examples for using `     GRANT INSERT    `

### GoogleSQL

``` text
GRANT INSERT ON TABLE employees, contractors TO ROLE hr_manager;

GRANT INSERT(name, address, phone) ON TABLE employees TO ROLE hr_rep;
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
GRANT INSERT ON TABLE employees, contractors TO hr_manager;

GRANT INSERT(name, address, phone) ON TABLE employees TO hr_rep;
```

## `     UPDATE    `

Allows the role to update rows in the specified tables. Updates can be restricted to a subset of table columns. When you use this with sequences, it allows the role to call the `  get-next-sequence-value  ` function on the sequence.

In addition to the `  UPDATE  ` privilege, the role needs the `  SELECT  ` privilege on all queried columns. Queried columns include columns in the `  WHERE  ` clause.

`  UPDATE  ` can't be granted on generated columns.

#### Examples for using `     GRANT UPDATE    `

### GoogleSQL

``` text
GRANT UPDATE ON TABLE employees, contractors TO ROLE hr_manager;

GRANT UPDATE(name, address, phone) ON TABLE employees TO ROLE hr_rep;
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
GRANT UPDATE ON TABLE employees, contractors TO hr_manager;

GRANT UPDATE(name, address, phone) ON TABLE employees TO hr_rep;
```

## `     DELETE    `

Allows the role to delete rows from the specified tables.

  - `  DELETE  ` can't be granted at the column level.

  - The role also needs `  SELECT  ` on any columns that might be included in the query's `  WHERE  ` clauses.

  - For interleaved tables in GoogleSQL-dialect databases, the `  DELETE  ` privilege is required only on the parent table. If a child table specifies `  ON DELETE CASCADE  ` , rows from the child table are deleted even without the `  DELETE  ` privilege on the child table.

#### Example for using `     GRANT DELETE    `

### GoogleSQL

``` text
GRANT DELETE ON TABLE employees, contractors TO ROLE hr_admin;
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
GRANT DELETE ON TABLE employees, contractors TO hr_admin;
```

## `     EXECUTE    `

When you grant `  SELECT  ` on a change stream, you must also grant `  EXECUTE  ` on the read function for the change stream. For more information, see [Change stream read functions and query syntax](/spanner/docs/change-streams/details#change_stream_query_syntax) .

When you use this with models, it allows the role to use the model in [machine learning functions](/spanner/docs/reference/standard-sql/ml-functions) .

#### Example for using `     GRANT EXECUTE    `

The following example shows how to grant `  EXECUTE  ` on the read function for the change stream named `  my_change_stream  ` .

### GoogleSQL

``` text
GRANT EXECUTE ON TABLE FUNCTION READ_my_change_stream TO ROLE hr_analyst;
```

### PostgreSQL

``` text
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION spanner.read_json_my_change_stream TO hr_analyst;
```

## USAGE

When you grant `  USAGE  ` to a named schema, it provides privileges to access objects contained in the named schema. The `  USAGE  ` privilege is granted, by default, to the default schema.
